I'm excited to announce the inaugural hyper user survey! (_Update: it ended._)

Part of being user-driven is [knowing what our users want][gov], what they're trying to do, and then we can figure out how best to help.

This survey should only take about 5 minutes, no questions are required, and responses are anonymous. The survey will be open for a month, until December 17th, and then we'll analyze the results and share with you all what we find.

Thanks for taking the time to help make [hyper][] better!
