[Rambling about Verizon](http://www.marco.org/725288444)  

> Apple’s quickly losing ground to Android today for only one reason: the majority of mobile-phone owners in the U.S. (the majority of people in the U.S.) choose their network first and their phone second.

I absolutely agree. I would love to have an iPhone, but not at the expense of a crappy network. And since Android and iPhone are comparable (_at least to me_), that’s why I’ll be using an Android. It’s also why my wife got an Android. And my in-laws. They didn’t want to switch networks, so when they saw the Android in store, went with it (_and they enjoy it very much_).

> Every month without a Verizon iPhone costs Apple dearly in marketshare and mindshare. The longer they wait, the lower their chances to reclaim the difference.
