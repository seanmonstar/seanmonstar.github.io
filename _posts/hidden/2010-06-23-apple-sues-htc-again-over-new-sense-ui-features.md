[Apple sues HTC again over new Sense UI features](http://androidandme.com/2010/06/news/apple-sues-htc-again-over-new-sense-ui-features/)  

We remember Apple’s first lawsuit against HTC. HTC responded in kind by suing for Apple’s own infringements on HTC patents.

Apparently, Apple isn’t done with the patent game. Now, they must sue for an extremely vague patent:

> System for real-time adaptation to changes in display configuration

The way HTC infringed? By allowing users to see all of their homescreens zoomed out. Something non-existent on the iPhone.

If only these companies could be content with trying to win based on a quality product alone.
