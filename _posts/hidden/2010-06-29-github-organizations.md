[Github Organizations](http://github.com/blog/674-introducing-organizations)  

This is super good news. Previously, an organization’s code was just another user. You’d need to login as that user to manage their stuff.

[Good news](http://twitter.com/kamicane/status/17385569319) for [MooTools](http://github.com/mootools) also, since all Open Source projects can convert into an organization for free.
