[Letter from Apple Regarding iPhone 4](http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2010/07/iphone-bars.html)  

[Apple](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/07/02appleletter.html):

> Upon investigation, we were stunned to find that the formula we use to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display is totally wrong.

And that is why touching the black strip on your iPhone 4 makes it drop signal… _wait, what?!_ That doesn’t even address it. All they’ve done is said they’re been wrongly advertising excellent coverage.

[Translated](http://daringfireball.net/2010/07/translation_iphone_4) into Basic English for us:

> Yes, with no case on the phone, your signal strength can drop by about 20 or even 30 percent depending how you hold the phone. We’re going to change the bar algorithm so that you’ll only lose one bar if you’re holding it that way.

Their “fix” is to now properly let you know how bad your coverage is. It’s still just as broken to bridge the gap of your antennas. There is still a hardware design flaw. Good thing they point out that if you realize they’re pulling a “Look over here, it’s AT&T” trick, you can still return your iPhone 4.
