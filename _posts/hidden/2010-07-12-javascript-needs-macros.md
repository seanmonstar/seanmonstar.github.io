[JavaScript needs macros?](http://meta2.tumblr.com/post/787368639)  

> [JavaScript needs modules](http://blog.mozilla.com/dherman/2010/07/08/javascript-needs-modules/)? No. JavaScript needs a macro compiler companion to extend the language with new statements.

I’m less sold. Opinions in a programing language are a good thing. Look at Python.
