[HTML5: Changing the browser-URL without refreshing page](http://www.spoiledmilk.dk/blog/?p=1922)  

Instead of having to do some `location.hash` [trickery to change around the page with JavaScript](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/making-an-ajax-single-page-site-with-mootools/), there is a new API for the History object that will support this natively.

Basically, youâ€™ll be changing the URL itself, without causing page refreshes.
