[A New Version Of Google Chrome Now Due Every Six Weeks](http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/22/google-chrome-versions/)  

I already love Chrome. I try to convince relatives and friends to use it. I managed to convince my [brother](http://tractorbeamtuesdays.tumblr.com) to move from Netscape to Chrome.

> With the new release schedule, even if something isn’t ready to go in one release, it will only be six weeks until it makes the next one.

And now, it’s going to get better, more often. How could you pick another browser in this current market?
