[Why smartphone openness is a lie](http://www.tipb.com/2010/07/23/iphone-android-smartphone-openness-lie/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheIphoneBlog+%28TiPb%3A+iPhone%2C+iPad%2C+iPod%29)  

I don’t hate on the iPhone. It’s a decent piece of hardware. I heavily debated with myself if it was the device I wanted for my personal use, but I ultimately decided on Android.

One reason is because Android phones are more open. So when I read crap like this:

> Bottom line, on a truly “open” Android device, you can’t even make a phone call

All I see is an Apple fanboy who must bash on Android because so many of us enjoy that Android is more open. I don’t care if everything is entirely open. What I care is that I don’t have an [overlord](http://apple.com) telling me what I can and cannot do with the device I own.

Any complaints I’ve seen are about the Droid X, and they’ve been cried as if it’s a problem in all of Android. I call **bah-log-na**.
