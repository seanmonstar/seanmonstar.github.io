[Stylebot](http://stylebot.me/)  

This is a _fantastic_ extension for Chrome. This lets you easily edit the styles of a web page, and have them be saved and applied next time you visit.

The demo shows one excellent use: improving a site you frequent. I did that for Kotaku/Lifehacker. I never use the Share box, and always mistake it for a search box. So, share box hidden, search box moved into place.

Also, I have refrained from Adblockers in the past because I don’t want to block _all_ ads. I respect websites’ needs to make money. But I don’t respect the need to make a website that is more about the ads than the content. So, certain websites that [cover their articles in flash ads](https://twitter.com/seanmonstar/status/22122514533), or have _far too many_ ads in the sidebar, have their ads hidden.

Yes, I know. Shame on me, etc.
