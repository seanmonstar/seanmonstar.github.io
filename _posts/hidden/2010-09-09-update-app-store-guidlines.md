[Updated App Store License Agreement](http://daringfireball.net/2010/09/app_store_guidelines)  

Mostly good news. I appreciated some of the casual bullet items at the start of the document, such as not wanting to fill the store with “amateur hour”.

However, [Sascha Segan](http://twitter.com/saschasegan/status/24016093103) expresses the same feeling I get when considering iOS apps:

> People say Apple is being more transparent, but their top app approval guideline is still “we’ll use our subjective judgement.”
