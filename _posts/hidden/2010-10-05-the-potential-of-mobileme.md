[The Potential of MobileMe](http://shawnblanc.net/2010/10/mobileme-potential/)  

Shawn:

> In its current state as “exchange for the rest of us” MobileMe seems neither exciting nor ambitious. […] And iDisk? Well, that is also collecting dust.

It truly is one of iOS’ biggest flaws: that lack of painless syncing. Android doesn’t have this problem; I’ve plugged [my phone](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/samsung-galaxy-vibrant-review/) into my computer two times, total.

While I feel that any developer making an application that uses data that could be accessed anywhere should build their own cloud service[^1], Android provides this to mobile developers who don’t know much about servers. You can use a `BackupAgent` to allow easy re-installation on a new phone, and use `addPeriodicSync` to sync any data the same way Calendar or Contacts syncs.



[^1]: Which shouldn’t be too hard for most developers. You just need a database, and a simple API to send and receive the data.
