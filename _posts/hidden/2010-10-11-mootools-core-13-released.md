[MooTools Core 1.3 Released](http://mootools.net/blog/2010/10/11/mootools-core-1-3-stable-and-mootools-more-1-3rc/)  

Improved speed, improved API decisions. Lots of hard work and tears went into this. Congratulations to the MooTools team.

Iâ€™m hurriedly converting my MVC framework to use 1.3, since it fixes a few issues in IE. I could just require the compat mode, but screw that. If you still want 1.2, you can use the compat yourself.
