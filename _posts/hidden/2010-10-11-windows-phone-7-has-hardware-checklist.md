[Windows Phone 7 Has Hardware Checklist](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/10/windows-phone-7-4)  

Wired:

> Each device must feature three standard hardware buttons, for example, and before they can ship with Windows Phone 7, they have to pass a series of tests directed by Microsoft.

This will certainly help WP7 to have less segmentation, and keep its brand a bit more uniform. I’m uncertain if the way Android allows the hardware to be anything in the world is a good or bad thing. It allows cheaper phones to be made, like the Charm, and still guarantees a decebt web browser, while allowing better phones to exist like my Galaxy.

I do wish Android’s “hardware” buttons were in a consistant order, though.
