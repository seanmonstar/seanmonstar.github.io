Tim Bray reviewing the Galaxy Tab:

> This is an excellent product. It’s fast, beautiful, useful, responsive, and convenient. If Samsung picks the right price point and channels, they’ll sell a ton.

Hopefully, they pick a good price for the WiFi version.

He also notes that his review should be balanced by someone not as biased, since he’s an Android evangelist working for Google.
