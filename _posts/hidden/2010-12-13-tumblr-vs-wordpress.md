I know tumblr has been increasingly flaky as of late. And there’s a lot of talk about hopping back onto Wordpress installations. The [quality of Wordpress’ code](http://twitter.com/#!/joestump/status/7466699872) aside, here’s is the **number one** reason I can never go back to Wordpress.

If I’m ever pushed to move, I’ll have to find or make my own installable blog software that has support for different posts types, but doesn’t have the terrible Wordpress clutter.
