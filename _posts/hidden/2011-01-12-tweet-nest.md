[Tweet Nest](http://pongsocket.com/tweetnest/)  

Really neat looking app to keep a viewable, searchable, and customizable archive of all your tweets. Since, you know, Twitter ditches all old tweets. Personally, Iâ€™ve setup a tumblr account to pull in all [my tweets](http://tweets.seanmonstar.com), but this definitely looks and functions better. It just costs having your own server.
