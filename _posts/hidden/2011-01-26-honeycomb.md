[Android 3.0 Platform Highlights](http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-3.0-highlights.html)  

It seems like we just had the 2.3 highlights, but I won’t complain about 3.0 coming quickly behind it.

I’m kind of torn with the new UI. Some parts of it look really stylish, like the email message view, or the contacts view. Yet, I feel other parts really clash with the metro-esque look. The whole bottom bar of buttons and the time look terrible. I’m also really not feeling the background they chose. It looks futuristic or Tron-like, but other parts of the UI look more minimalist.

On the major plus side, it will only take one line of code for developers to turn on hardware accelerated graphics for their entire application. The multi-core stuff looks promising as well.
