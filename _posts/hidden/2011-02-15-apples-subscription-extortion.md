[Apple’s Subscription Extortion](http://thinkvitamin.com/web-industry/why-you-should-fight-apples-subscription-extortion/)  

Much evil has been done in the name of business. Here’s some more from Apple (surprise, surprise):

> A lot of apps aimed at the web community will fall into this camp – not big enough to be featured by the App Store because the niche is too small. Therefore there is no extra marketing value from being in the App Store and forking over the extra 30% to Apple.

For instance, in a personal web app of mine, when I start to offer pro accounts, and I wanted to have an iPhone app, I would _have_ to let Apple take 30% of my subscription. Even though the use of the iPhone app would be minor compared to that customer coming to the actual website. No, Apple, you don’t get 30% of my hardwork. Instead, Apple just gets less apps in its App Store.

Commenter farra puts it:

> Apple only hosts the app code, they don’t host all your backend services, or pay the bandwidth for the delivery of in-app media. This is a 30% payment processing fee, which is hugely out of line in the larger market.

I wonder what happens to 3rd party apps that tie into subscription-based web apps, like Campfire.
