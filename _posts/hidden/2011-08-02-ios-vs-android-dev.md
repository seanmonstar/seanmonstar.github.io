[An iOS Developer Takes on Android](http://nfarina.com/post/8239634061/ios-to-android)  

An unbiased look at programming for Android, after having programmed for iOS. He gave it a good go, and realized that it’s terribleness has been exaggerated.[^1]

About Eclipse:

> You’re going to just _hate_ Eclipse. You’re going to hate it with the heat of a thousand suns. […] The upside is, after acclimating to Eclipse, you’ll enjoy some seriously amazing, productivity-boosting code completion, refactoring, and automatic fixing. It’ll basically write your code for you.

And Android’s View system:

> The best part is that it’s zero-effort-easy to make layouts that automatically resize for portrait/landscape device orientations and varying screen sizes. This is in stark contrast to the absolutely primitive springs and struts system in Cocoa/iOS.

It’s a true shame about the animation issues, however.



[^1]: By iOS developers who’ve tried for an hour to set up Eclipse, give up, and declare Android programming to be the devil.
