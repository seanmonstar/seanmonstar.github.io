[Web Intents](http://blog.chromium.org/2011/08/connecting-web-apps-with-web-intents.html)  

Web Intents are a seriously cool and useful idea. Android already has [Intents](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/intents/intents-filters.html), and [I love them](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/send-to-is-easy-in-android/). It letâ€™s applications that know nothing about each other be able to interact. The Google Chrome team and [Mozilla](http://mozillalabs.com/blog/2011/07/web-apps-update-experiments-in-web-activities-app-discovery/) are both hard at work making this a reality.
