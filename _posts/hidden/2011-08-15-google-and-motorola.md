[Google and Motorola](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/supercharging-android-google-to-acquire.html)  

I’m sure you’ve seen else where that Google has bought Motorola. While people are busy talking about the boring patent portfolio that Google gains, I’m more interested in this part by Larry Page:

> Motorola’s total commitment to Android in mobile devices is one of many reasons that there is a natural fit between our two companies. Together, we will create amazing user experiences that supercharge the entire Android ecosystem for the benefit of consumers, partners and developers everywhere.

Google’s Nexus devices are the “pure” Android experience, and are far better devices for it. With Google now directly controlling how the hardware should match the software, this could mean many more devices that don’t get the OEM skin-cruft, and far faster updates. Hopefully we’ll see less [devices that make Android look bad](http://www.betabeat.com/2011/07/29/why-my-mom-bought-an-android-returned-it-and-got-an-iphone/).

Also an interesting note, is that Google will now be making money directly related the quality of their software and hardware combination. We’ll see how this affects features and the user experience, as opposed to currently, where Google only makes money indirectly through ads in mobile search.

**Update** : On the flip side, what if Google offered high quality Motorola phones for super cheap (free after a new contract), eating the cost at having more people having good Android’s in their hands? With good, fast devices, there would be more searchs, and more Maps usage. Both would be an increase to places Google could advertise. Just a thought.
