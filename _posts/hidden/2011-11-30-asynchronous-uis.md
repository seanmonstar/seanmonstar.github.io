[Asynchronous UIs](http://alexmaccaw.co.uk/posts/async_ui)  

A great post by Alex McCaw, creator of the [Spine](https://github.com/maccman/spine) MVC JavaScript[^1] framework, about how front-end developers do Ajax interactions wrong. Users shouldn’t be stopped because we’re waiting on the server to respond. The interface should respond immediately, and a background sync action should be kicked off.

I’ve been thinking about this for the past year, and wanted to reflect these ideas in [Shipyard](https://github.com/seanmonstar/Shipyard), and make them come alive in the Add-on Builder, myself.
