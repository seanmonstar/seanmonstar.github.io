[Samsung Will Not Upgrade Galaxy S Phones](http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-will-not-upgrade-galaxy-s-phones-2012-1)  

Samsung, regarding upgrading the Galaxy S software to Android 4:

> A full update to Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich for the GALAXY Tab(7-inch) and GALAXY S is not practicable due to hardware limitations.

This, as the Nexus S (which is the same internal hardware) is running Android 4 right now.

If an OEM were to release less phones a year, but provide excellent support for them for more than a year<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I could strongly recommend to my friends to only buy from them. But I can’t recommend Samsung, since they don’t.

I can only recommend [Google’s Nexus](http://google.com/nexus) brand, now.

Heck, most OEMs hardly support their devices for more than a month.&nbsp;[↩︎](#fnref:1)
