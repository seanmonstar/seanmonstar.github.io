[A Broadcasting Network](http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/31/2760338/twitter-ceo-dick-costolo-broadcasting-social-network?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter)  

Dieter Bohn, over at The Verge, describing Twitter’s evolution:

> The recent redesign of the Twitter web pages and its official Twitter apps that shuffled Direct Messages off to a corner is essentially a side effect of this basic attitude: Twitter isn’t a messaging company, it’s a broadcasting (social) network.

The thing is, I’ve only ever seen it as a broadcasting network. To me, it’s an extension of my blog. I can write things on Twitter that are short, and perhaps less important, because the barrier and expectation is lower. I never expect to have deep conversations over Twitter.

As much as Twitter hated the term earlier, they are starting to accept that it is a micro-blogging platform.
