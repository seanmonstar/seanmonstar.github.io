[Boot to Gecko](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/b2g/)  

This is Mozilla’s way of making the web be a capable platform for the mobile world. Instead of having to write Objective-C, or Java, and then, only being able to distribute through certain walled gardens, Boot to Gecko makes websites first-class citizens.

This means developers only need to make a website, using technology they already know, and their app is freely available (or they can charge, of course) to anyone who’s mobile device implements the modern web.

Specifically, Boot to Gecko has every single part written in HTML and JavaScript, including the home screen, the dialer, the SMS app, all of it. [The Verge has a write up and video](http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/27/2827659/mozillas-boot-to-gecko-project-the-internet-is-your-phone-hands-on) showing excellent performance, which is great news.

This is **big**.
