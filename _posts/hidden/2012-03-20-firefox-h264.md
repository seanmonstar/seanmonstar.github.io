[Firefox and H.264](http://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/03/video-mobile-and-the-open-web/)  

Brendan Eich of Mozilla:

> What I do know for certain is this: H.264 is absolutely required right now to compete on mobile. I do not believe that we can reject H.264 content in Firefox on Android or in B2G and survive the shift to mobile.

I can’t say I care too much about the non-openness of H.264, but I’m glad Mozilla does. The only thing allowing movie producers to use H.264 encoding is a “promise” that the owner of the technology won’t charge them. If it ever goes away, and all those people get charged for using H.264, I won’t have to pay directly, but the Internet will suffer as producers scramble to do something about it. That means I will be affected anyways.

Still, everyone else thinks it’s better to just move forward with H.264 because there’s already hardware that supports it.[^1] Mozilla is the only one that has stood against it, and now, all Firefox users get video through Flash, instead of the native HTML5 `video` element like the rest of the Internet.

The goal is to allow H.264 to play, but to continue to fight for a better technology as well.
