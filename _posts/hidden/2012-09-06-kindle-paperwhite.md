[Kindle Paperwhite](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007OZNZG0/?tag=seanmonstar-20)  

Of the things Amazon announced today, the [Kindle Paperwhite](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007OZNZG0/?tag=seanmonstar-20) interests me the most. I was curious to know what exactly was new in this one, and found the [video](http://www.amazon.com/gp/mpd/permalink/m9OMW36M7OB0R/?tag=seanmonstar-20) they have on the product page to be worth watching.

Particularly, my wife has a Kindle, and she always comments how nice and light it is when she uses it, but she’s often reading on a tablet more than the Kindle. She gives two reasons why, and the Paperwhite should alleviate them:

1. She can’t read her Kindle in the dark.
2. It’s clunky to download new books using the Kindle (pre Touch version).
