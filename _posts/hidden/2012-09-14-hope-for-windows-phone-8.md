[Owen Williams says exactly how I feel regarding Windows Phone 8](http://owened.co.nz/why-i-wont-be-buying-an-iphone-5-6):

> I want Windows Phone 8 to succeed, because Microsoft is the only one who truly understands that end users are real people.

It’s exactly the reason I haven’t upgraded my aging Galaxy S to a newer Android device.
