[Disney's Star Wars](http://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-news/press-releases/2012/10/disney-acquire-lucasfilm-ltd)  

You’ve likely already heard: [Disney bought Lucasfilm](http://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-news/press-releases/2012/10/disney-acquire-lucasfilm-ltd). And they plan to release a new Star Wars movie in 2015.

If they go the route of [KOTOR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic), and create a brand new story like 1000 years before the trilogy, this could be pretty cool. If they continue Luke’s story after _Return of the Jedi_, and trample over the [canonical Expanded Universe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Expanded_Universe), I think Star Wars fans will burn down Disneyland.
