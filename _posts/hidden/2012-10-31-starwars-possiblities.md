["When Lucas lets other people play in his sandbox, wonderful things can happen."](http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/disney-purchasing-lucasfilm-is-the-best-thing-to-happen-to-star-wars-in-a-d)  

Ben Kuchara of The PA Report, talking about the exciting times ahead for Star Wars:

> We can all point to wonderful pieces of Star Wars fiction. The Thrawn Trilogy by Timothy Zahn was a fun read. The Knights of the Old Republic games were amazing. The Clone Wars television show is very good. Star Wars has been treated well in books, comics, video games, televisionâ€¦ everywhere but the films made by Lucas himself.
