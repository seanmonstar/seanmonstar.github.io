[SmartGlass](http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/not-all-apps-are-created-equal-the-sometimes-brilliant-use-of-xbox-smartgla)  

> My only gripe is that while SmartGlass itself reacts the way you would expect, controlling your Xbox with your connected device does not.

As much as [I hoped Microsoft would better integrate my living room](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/future-of-xbox/), it definitely seems like they fell a little short. At the same time, it suddenly gives me more use and features for free.[^1] I just hope they release some updates such that interacting with my Xbox becomes an absolute delight. I’d buy the next one if they do.



[^1]: It’d be cool if they make [my Star Wars viewing](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/machete-order/) more enhanced, with additional info, or a map of where in the galaxy the scene is. _That_ would be awesome.
