[A Better Publishing Model](http://www.usabilitypost.com/2012/11/26/the-gleam-of-a-better-publishing-model/)  

Dmitry Fadeyev proposes an Web-based Newstand:

> What’s needed is a marketplace much like Apple’s Newsstand, but for the Web.

Add that with Ryan Singer’s comments about a [Movable Type for iOS](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3334-tablets-are-waiting-for-their-movable-type), and I think we’re thinking in the right direction.

Somewhere in the middle, that allows publications to write their articles in HTML, like they already know how, and get their “issues” delivered in the background and with subscriptions, on iOS, Android, and any other platform that becomes popular. And the content is still available on a website, for those people who want to use a traditional computer.
