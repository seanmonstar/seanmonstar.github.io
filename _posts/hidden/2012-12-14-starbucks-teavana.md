[Starbucks + Teavana](http://www.themorningnews.org/article/a-spot-for-tea)  

[Starbucks buying Teavana](http://money.cnn.com/2012/11/14/news/starbucks-teavana/index.html) could do great things for tea:

> If Starbucks is willing to do the heavy lifting, willing to suggest to a populace that Chinese teas are more than a complement to General Tso’s chicken, willing to point out the difference between an oolong and a pu-erh, I will be much obliged.

This article reminded me of what [Starbucks did previously to coffee](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/hey_wait_a_minute/2007/12/dont_fear_starbucks.single.html): made otherwise non-coffee drinkers aware of coffee, and then made some of them go find _good_ coffee.

> Local consumers might have a formative experience with a Java Chip Frappuccino, but chances are they’ll branch out to the cheaper, less crowded, and often higher-quality independent cafe later on.
