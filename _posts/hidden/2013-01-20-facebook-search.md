[Facebook Search](http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/15/3879520/facebook-tackles-google-linkedin-yelp-graph-search)  

Interesting trend that Tim Carmody notices:

> Facebook, effectively, becomes the new Yahoo, but something closer to what Yahoo, or AOL before that, was before the rise of Google.

It is interesting to think about how when the web was starting, we all used AOL and Yahoo as launching points to other parts of the web. Eventually, those things died, and we went straight to the URL bar. However, for most non-geeks, it definitely looks like the trend will reverse, and people will go to Facebook first, and then elsewhere on the internet as they find links.
