[Gamers are every where](http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/what-the-mainstream-press-wont-report-gamers-are-everywhere-and-were-doing-)  

> We’ve been told by the media that our hobby is somehow different and other in some unspoken way, as though it’s okay to have a drink after work and watch a football game, but playing XCOM is somehow wrong.

> We’re already running the country. We treat you when you’re sick. We help you fill out forms for your home loan. We protect you in court, and we may arrest you when you break the law. We send our children to school and we raise them well.

This is one of the best articles I’ve read on “being a gamer”, ever.
