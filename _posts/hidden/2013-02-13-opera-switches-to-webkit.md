[Opera Switches to WebKit](http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2013/02/13/)  

This is not something to celebrate.

Sure, everyone thinks that since WebKit is currently rocking it, that everyone should just switch to it, and stop “wasting” time competing. The truth is, that’s [what happened to IE6](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/11/microsoft-begs-web-devs-not-to-make-webkit-the-new-ie6/). It was the new hotness when it came out, but without competition, it sizzled.

A more recent example: CSS gradients. If there were no competing browsers, the de-facto standard of gradients would be what the [WebKit came up with](https://www.webkit.org/blog/175/introducing-css-gradients/), instead of the saner version in the [specification](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-images/#linear-gradients).
