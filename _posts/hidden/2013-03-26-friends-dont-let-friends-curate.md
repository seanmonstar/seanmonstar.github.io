[Friends Don’t Let Friends Curate](https://medium.com/future-tech-future-market/6d22522ebe7f?source=email)  

> As we all venture further and further into the depths of the internet we find people that share our interests. Lots of them, actually. Letting these people – people you look up to or share interests with or share careers with – curate the content you see starts to make more sense than letting your great aunt Sally run the show.

This sums up why we always want something besides Facebook. We want to see content from people who are experts in the topics we like, not from people we get along with who happen to be physically located near us.
