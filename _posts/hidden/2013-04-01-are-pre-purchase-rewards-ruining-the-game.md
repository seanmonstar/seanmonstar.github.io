[Are Pre-Purchase Rewards Ruining the Game Industry?](http://rolltonotdie.com/post/46385886573/pre-orders-on-parade-are-pre-purchase-rewards-ruining)  

You’ve noticed that terrible practice also, right? The one where you see a game trailer, and then at the end it tells you the list of stores you can pre-order it from, and which bonus-piece-of-crap you’ll get from each?

Kyle McArthur has an excellent [in-depth critique of the practice](http://rolltonotdie.com/post/46385886573/pre-orders-on-parade-are-pre-purchase-rewards-ruining):

> If you buy the game, you’re voting that whatever the developers, publishers, or retailers did, worked. It doesn’t matter if you only liked some of it, and didn’t like other parts, the money speaks for you.

Worth a read. And a scotch.
