Android launchers have been all pretty similar, just with a few different bits of customization. I can honestly say that [Shutters](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrislacy.actionlauncher.pro) are an awesome new feature added to my Android device. Swipe up on an icon, and it shows the related widget.

I know, right?
