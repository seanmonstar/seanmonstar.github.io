['Teens aren’t abandoning “social.” They’re just using the word correctly.'](https://medium.com/understandings-epiphanies/aae8d5f880cc?utm_source=newsletter14&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=long14wl)  

> You see, we’ve come to define “social” in unintentional Orwellian double-speak. “Social” has come to mean the exact opposite of what it’s meant for centuries. Instead of actual interaction and communication, we define “social” as once- or twice-removed ego validation through button-clicking.

Ding.
