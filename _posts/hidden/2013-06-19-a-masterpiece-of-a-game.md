[A masterpiece of a game](http://www.edge-online.com/features/most-games-are-too-short-and-thats-why-they-get-traded-in-says-avalanche-boss/)  

[Kyle McArthur, on how to recognize a masterpiece](http://rolltonotdie.com/post/53265599480/most-games-are-too-short-thats-why-they-get-traded-in):

> I think that may be the mark of a truly masterpiece game - when a game’s experience is so good, that I want to do it over and over, rather than needing new choices or paths to create new content and make it fresh again.

It’s so true. Most new games claim replayability by having new choices to make, but I find that many times, the gameplay just wasn’t amazing enough to play again with different choices. Yet, some games you play over and over, despite no new choices.
