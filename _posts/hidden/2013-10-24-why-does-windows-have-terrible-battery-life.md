> We’re at a loss to understand why Windows’ terrible – and worsening! – idle battery life performance isn’t the source of far more industry outrage.

In my completely scientific experience, my 3 year-old laptop with Windows 7 typically gets 2.5 hours of usage. When I boot the same laptop into Ubuntu 13.04, it gets 5.5 hours. Wut.
