<p>I&rsquo;ve seen several big name <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/08/from-table-hell-to-div-hell/">web-sites</a> point out this argument about whether or not CSS is worse for making web-sites than tables were, and <em>I&rsquo;m honestly getting sick of it</em> . <a href="http://fredbrunel.com/journal/2006/08/tables-are-not-evil/">Some</a> (self-proclaimed?) <a href="http://iamelgringo.blogspot.com/2009/02/tables-vs-css-css-trolls-begone.html">bigwigs</a> in the web industry are even saying it&rsquo;s easier to use tables and that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re going to use for now. I assume everyone knows the reasons for using standards, semantic html, cascading stylesheets, and the like instead of tables. The benefits are enormous. But is it really too hard?</p>
<h4>First, No, It&rsquo;s not hard.</h4>
<p>Honestly, writing HTML semantically is super easy. All you&rsquo;re doing is defining content. That block of text is a paragraph. The first line is a heading. That list is, gasp, a list! That&rsquo;s the easiest part. Then, after you&rsquo;ve defined content logically, you open up a CSS file and style away.</p>
<p>Anyone who&rsquo;s had to transform a design into CSS a few times and knows most CSS properties available knows it&rsquo;s not hard at all! It takes a couple hours to turn a design into a web-site. But perhaps I&rsquo;m biased - I get <em>it</em> . I get CSS. What about people who don&rsquo;t? I can see that, certainly not everyone excels at the same things. So some people might have much more of a difficult time wrestling with the browsers box model. For people like that, here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s up:</p>
<h4>Web-sites Aren&rsquo;t For You</h4>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t understand or work with the new technologies of an industry, then likely, <strong>this industry isn&rsquo;t for you</strong> . <em>Can someone honestly call themselves a web professional if they can&rsquo;t use the tools the web requires?</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s equivalent to someone learning programming, and asking them to build a game in Java, for instance. If they could not wrap their mind around Object-Oriented design, would it be sufficient for them to say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just going to write one gigantic function, because it&rsquo;s easier than trying to understand all that Object junk.&rdquo; &hellip;. Fired.</p>
<h4>But You Love Web-sites</h4>
<p>Perhaps you can&rsquo;t work with CSS very well, but you still love web-sites. Ok, so you don&rsquo;t have to leave the industry, but realize what you can and cannot do! If you&rsquo;re a designer, and you make pretty things, don&rsquo;t bash CSS because you find it easier to just press Slice in Photoshop. Stick to making pretty combinations of pixels, and let someone else do it.</p>
<p>Or maybe you&rsquo;re a developer (I&rsquo;d find this much rarer, but who knows), and you can&rsquo;t be bothered with the stupid standards of browsers. It&rsquo;s too non-standard or non-programmery for you. That&rsquo;s fine. Stick to optimizing the database and give the front-end people quick and efficient queries. Stick to your thing.</p>
<p>But just because something is hard for you, doesn&rsquo;t mean the proper response is do it the stupid-er way.</p>
