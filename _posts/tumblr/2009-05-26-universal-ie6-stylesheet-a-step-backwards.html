<p>As many have noted, there&rsquo;s many opinions on how to handle the Internet Explorer 6 monster. <a target="_blank" href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/">For a beautiful web</a> just suggested his solution: <a target="_blank" href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/blog/about/universal_internet_explorer_6_css/">one stylesheet to rule them all</a> . It&rsquo;s completely ridiculous, and I&rsquo;m suprised to see other professionals agreeing.</p>
<h4>A Relatively Capable Browser</h4>
<p>IE6, while certainly layout-challenged, can handle basic layout, and still decent color, background, type and image support. People using Internet Explorer 6 are used to web pages looking decent. Websites looking plain black and white with no design all of a sudden will make people think your site is broken (or just sucks). And one principle of web standards is that <em>they shouldn&rsquo;t think your website is broken</em> .</p>
<p>Sure you could change the text colors, you say. But c'mon, its really not that bad to remove the problematic CSS from IE6. <a target="_blank" href="http://boagworld.com/design/a-demonstration-of-graded-browser-support">Boagworld did a good job</a> of showing how easy it is to do, and it still looks pretty decent.</p>
<h4>The Standards Stance</h4>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;ll be the first to condemn IE6</strong> to the farthest depths of the trash can. I hate the bugger. But as a web developer, I also strongly believe in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/understandingprogressiveenhancement/">progressive enhancement</a> , and giving each browser what it can handle.</p>
<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;m asked to make something look the same in IE6 as Firefox 3, and while I do it (I need to eat), I strongly disagree with it. My boss expects some whining from my side of the office when I&rsquo;m told. I agree more with <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/gbs/">Yahoo&rsquo;s graded browser support</a> .</p>
<p>The plain stylesheet to IE6 turns it into a cousin of Lynx, and certainly under-utilizes the power that IE6 does have. Ultimately, <strong>it goes against the point of standards</strong> . Why bother at all, if you aren&rsquo;t going to treat everyone the way they can.</p>
