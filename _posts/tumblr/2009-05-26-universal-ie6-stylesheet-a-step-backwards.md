As many have noted, there’s many opinions on how to handle the Internet Explorer 6 monster. [For a beautiful web](http://forabeautifulweb.com/) just suggested his solution: [one stylesheet to rule them all](http://forabeautifulweb.com/blog/about/universal_internet_explorer_6_css/) . It’s completely ridiculous, and I’m suprised to see other professionals agreeing.

#### A Relatively Capable Browser

IE6, while certainly layout-challenged, can handle basic layout, and still decent color, background, type and image support. People using Internet Explorer 6 are used to web pages looking decent. Websites looking plain black and white with no design all of a sudden will make people think your site is broken (or just sucks). And one principle of web standards is that _they shouldn’t think your website is broken_ .

Sure you could change the text colors, you say. But c'mon, its really not that bad to remove the problematic CSS from IE6. [Boagworld did a good job](http://boagworld.com/design/a-demonstration-of-graded-browser-support) of showing how easy it is to do, and it still looks pretty decent.

#### The Standards Stance

**I’ll be the first to condemn IE6** to the farthest depths of the trash can. I hate the bugger. But as a web developer, I also strongly believe in [progressive enhancement](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/understandingprogressiveenhancement/) , and giving each browser what it can handle.

Sometimes I’m asked to make something look the same in IE6 as Firefox 3, and while I do it (I need to eat), I strongly disagree with it. My boss expects some whining from my side of the office when I’m told. I agree more with [Yahoo’s graded browser support](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/gbs/) .

The plain stylesheet to IE6 turns it into a cousin of Lynx, and certainly under-utilizes the power that IE6 does have. Ultimately, **it goes against the point of standards**. Why bother at all, if you aren’t going to treat everyone the way they can.
