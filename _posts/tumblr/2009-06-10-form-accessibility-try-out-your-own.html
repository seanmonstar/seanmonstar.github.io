<p>With web standards being all the rage, and accessibility being a major driving factor in people adopting standards, you might be surprised to actually check out the accessibility of web-sites. After watching <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmUPhEVWu_E">a video of a blind user using Jaws</a>, I figured to give using a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nvda-project.org/">screen reader</a> a try just to see if I could understand it any better. I ran into a couple problematic areas; what caught my attention first was the use of <strong>forms</strong> .</p>
<h4>When Things Were Right</h4>
<p>When a form was built properly, I could easily understand what inputs a form had, and what input I had tabbed to. Quite simply, <em>there were 2 tags the specifically improved the accessibility of the form</em> for my screen reader: <code>legend</code> and <code>label</code> .</p>
<pre><code>&lt;fieldset&gt;    </code></pre>
<pre><code>&lt;legend&gt;Personal&lt;/legend&gt;    ...&lt;/fieldset&gt;</code></pre>
<p>When I tabbed to an <code>input</code> that was within a <code>fieldset</code> , and that <code>fieldset</code> had a <code>legend</code> , it would tell me. The above would read to me: &ldquo;Personal grouping.&rdquo; So if this <code>fieldset</code> wrapped up inputs like your name, telephone, and e-mail address, it would remind me each time that this <code>input</code> was part of the &ldquo;Personal grouping&rdquo;, so I knew I hadn&rsquo;t tabbed to a new <code>fieldset</code> . Good.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;label&gt;    &lt;input name="personal:name" type="text" /&gt;    &lt;span&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/label&gt;</code></pre>
<p>For specific inputs, having a <code>label</code> did exactly as we would hope. I tabbed to the <code>input</code> , and it read the <code>label</code> and <code>input</code> type: &ldquo;Name, text.&rdquo; It specifically worked with the above example, when the <code>input</code> was inside a <code>label</code> . It would read the rest of the text inside the <code>label</code> .</p>
<h4>When Things Sucked</h4>
<p>I visited a few other sites that seemed to be using standards, and found that their forms performed far worse. It showed that <em>using the correct structure for forms is actually very important</em> . When a form used a simple paragraph before an input, with no <code>label</code> , guess what happened? Yep, it skipped it. When I tabbed to an <code>input</code> , it would just read me: &ldquo;Text&rdquo;. Hey, great. Any text? You got it: poop.</p>
<p>Yea, not good.</p>
<h5>Even worse</h5>
<p>Even if someone managed to make up information for these fields, or perhaps, say they did have labels on them, one more form feature that screwed my experience using a screen reader: <strong>captcha</strong> . Some implementations simply had an image above the input, with no alt tag, no possible way for me to ever prove I&rsquo;m a human being. Minus one call to action.</p>

<h4>Try Out Your Own</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;d suggest grabbing <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nvda-project.org/">NVDA</a>, and surfing your site, and pay attention to your forms. See if the way you made them makes sense to a screen reader. And then visit some of your favorite sites, try out their forms, and compare with their markup. It&rsquo;s quite enlightening.</p>
