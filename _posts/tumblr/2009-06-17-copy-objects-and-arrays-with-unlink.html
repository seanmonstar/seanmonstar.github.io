<p>Basically, if you don&rsquo;t know what happens when you have multiple variables pointing to the same Object or Array, then check out this <a target="_blank" href="http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/deep-copying-of-objects-and-arrays/">quick and dirty article</a> and read the first half or so. Or if you don&rsquo;t want to bother, I&rsquo;ll give you a snippet to paste into Firebug.</p>
<pre><code>var a = ['one','b',3,false];
var b = a;
a[1] = 'BEEEE';
console.log(b[1]);</code></pre>
<h4>Reference, pointer, whatever</h4>
<p>Caught on to what was happening there? We made one array, then assigned that array to another variable. That variable simply points at the same array, it&rsquo;s not copied. Now, when we change the array that&rsquo;s assigned a, we find the results of the change appearing b also.</p>
<p>This is because Javascript assigns complex types (notably Objects and Arrays (Functions and Strings count too, but they&rsquo;re immutable, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter)) by pointers. Usually called pass by reference, there might be some argument over the proper verbage. Ultimately, it doesn&rsquo;t matter much what you call it when you talk to yourself. It just matters that you understand what happens.</p>
<h4>Making Distinct Copies</h4>
<p>Now, sometimes, you may want a copy of the array or object instead of a reference, so if the original gets modified, your copy stays out of that sometimes confusing mess. There are a couply ways of copying an array or object, but what matters here, is that if one of the values is itself an array or object, you&rsquo;ll need to make a copy of that as well. Otherwise you&rsquo;ll get pointers in your facade of a copied object.</p>
<h5>$unlink</h5>
<p>The MooTools Core (1.2.2 as of writing) provides a function by the name of $unlink that solves this issue for us. Provide an array or object as an argument of $unlink, and it will return a copy that has been checked to make sure it has no back references. Let&rsquo;s do so to our original example.</p>
<pre><code>var a = ['one','b',3,false];
var b = $unlink(a);
a[1] = 'BEEEE';
console.log(b[1]);</code></pre>
<p>See? They&rsquo;re different.  Go ahead and play with making arrays and objects that contain nested objects, and see what happens.  Then you&rsquo;ll see the power that <code>$unlink</code> gives you.</p>
