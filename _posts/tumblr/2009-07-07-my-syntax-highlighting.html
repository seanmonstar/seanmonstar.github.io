<p>One of the most obvious benefits to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ultraedit.com/">code editors</a> and <a href="http://mcarthurgfx.com/blog/article/php-designer-2008">IDEs</a> is being able to customize all the pretty colors that we must stare at for hours on end. It&rsquo;s our decoration. <strong>It&rsquo;s our wardrobe</strong>. So let me show off my own code outfitting.</p>
<h4>Monstar Code</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve toyed around with various schemes, and have settled on my preferred colors. It might be influenced from the first time I used an editor in college (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>), but it&rsquo;s changed and grown some.</p>
<p>I recall some people at my former work quite liked the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1773-how-to-mock-alternate-states-of-a-new-ui-template-using-helpers">inverted look</a>. You know, light colors on a black or dark grey background. I wanted to like it: it kinda seems cool. But ultimately it was a little too weird for me.</p>
<p>However, this is a shot of my color scheme in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.activestate.com/komodo/">Komodo</a> (I try to duplicate the scheme in any editor I use).</p>
<p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="336" data-orig-width="500"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/f313fc69204781190e36890f85ce9b2f/b2caa0e9b1e57f0b-1c/s540x810/467538c1918ec4de30ee2123aa35b36fd20afaba.jpg" data-orig-height="336" data-orig-width="500"/></figure></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll list the colors I use:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Keywords</strong> - Blue. This would things like public, function, true, false, null, if, for, return, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Variables</strong> - Light blue.</li>
<li><strong>Strings</strong> - Green.</li>
<li><strong>Operators</strong> - Black.  Arithmetic, assignment, parenthesis, the like.</li>
<li><strong>Numbers</strong> - Dark Brown.</li>
<li><strong>Comments</strong> - Grey.  I prefer comments to be more hidden unless I specifically want to read them.</li>
<li><strong>Identifiers</strong> - Black.  These are function calls, or accessing properties of objects.</li>
<li><strong>Standard Library</strong> - Red.  Methods or constants defined in the standard library, I like them to stick out so I know when I&rsquo;m using native functions (ex:print_r, preg_match, etc).</li>
</ul><p>You&rsquo;ll also see that I enjoy a slightly off-white background, to cut down on the extreme photon abuse of my eyes. Just feels less&hellip; painful.</p>
<h4>Other Editors</h4>
<p>Komodo (seen above) doesn&rsquo;t allow me to do my last list item, coloring standard library names. I certainly wish it did, and if you know how, please do tell. However, I also use UltraEdit as it opens faster and uses less memory, and it <em>does</em>allow me to set standard functions red. I believe Eclipse allowed me to do this (it&rsquo;s been a while use I&rsquo;ve used it), and my recent checking out of Aptana showed it was possible.</p>
<p>In fact, Aptana seemed to have the more power for customizing color schemes. Not only could you select colors for groups of syntax, like &lsquo;keywords&rsquo;, you could then drill into keywords and say specifically that for and while should be different colors.</p>
<h4>Besides Color</h4>
<p>When given the option, I also enjoy when an editor allows me to modify the fonts of specific syntax. I like making comments italic, as it just seems to help make them&hellip; sleeker, more invisible, except when I need them. I don&rsquo;t use it personally, but I could see benefit to maybe adding bold to identifiers, or keywords, to make sure you don&rsquo;t miss out on any returns, for instance.</p>
<p>Of the many differences between coders, syntax highlighting is nearly a constant. However, coloring styles differ, as certain colors might have different psychological effects on the viewer.</p>
