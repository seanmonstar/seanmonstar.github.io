[I'm a Twitter Monstar](http://twitter.com/seanmonstar)  

I’ve been twitting… tweeting… using Twitter for, oh, a little while now. I can’t actually remember, maybe since the beginning of the year. And I’ve never really let anyone know, other then putting my latest tweet on the right side of my web-site.

I go by the name [seanmonstar](http://twitter.com/seanmonstar) on Twitter, since that was what my best friend called me through school. “Sean Mon-starrrrr!” Way cool, as far as I’m concerned.

Figured, now’s as great a time as any. Here’s a snapshot of what I twit tweet.

And yes, we do have an [“Out of beer” ticket](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/2008-10-16-our-most-critical-bug/).
