But after staring at text for a while, you have to break it up! And many developers have toys on their desk for just this reason. Mine&rsquo;s a Rubik&rsquo;s Cube.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00081RYNC?tag=mcgf-20">3x3x3 Rubik&rsquo;s Cube</a> sitting on my desk since I started professionally programming. Recently, I also snagged a 2x2x2 off eBay for barely $2, which gives me a faster solve (hence a shorter break), as well as a slightly different routine to my breaks. They serve as ways to make my wrists and fingers do something else besides sit on a keyboard. And they can be fun toys for the couple of visitors I&rsquo;ve had.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not much of a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing">speedcuber</a>, though I did try. I couldn&rsquo;t get passed 50ish seconds for the 3x3x3 (fast solves are around <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrjkjz1l4qw&amp;NR=1">20 seconds</a>). Now I <em>sluggishly </em>solve it in a minute and half. This lets me solve it a couple times if I want, or simply solve it once real quick and then get back to coding.</p>
