Sitting in front of a computer all day long can get boring. Sure, I love what I do. But after staring at text for a while, you have to break it up! And many developers have toys on their desk for just this reason. Mine’s a Rubik’s Cube.

I’ve had a [3x3x3 Rubik’s Cube](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00081RYNC?tag=mcgf-20) sitting on my desk since I started professionally programming. Recently, I also snagged a 2x2x2 off eBay for barely $2, which gives me a faster solve (hence a shorter break), as well as a slightly different routine to my breaks. They serve as ways to make my wrists and fingers do something else besides sit on a keyboard. And they can be fun toys for the couple of visitors I’ve had.

I’m not much of a [speedcuber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing), though I did try. I couldn’t get passed 50ish seconds for the 3x3x3 (fast solves are around [20 seconds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xrjkjz1l4qw&NR=1)). Now I _sluggishly_ solve it in a minute and half. This lets me solve it a couple times if I want, or simply solve it once real quick and then get back to coding.
