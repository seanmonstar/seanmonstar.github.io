[MooTools: A Better Way to Use Elements](http://mootools.net/blog/2010/03/19/a-better-way-to-use-elements/)  

I’ve started contributing to the MooTools blog, and today my post about all the cool things that the Element module does for us in MooTools.

It’s covers:

- Differences between `$` and `$$` 
- How to create a new Element (better-er) 
- How `$` and `toElement` interact 
- The special properties of the return value of `$$`
