<p>My contract is up super soon. I&rsquo;m thinking of waiting the month to get this super slick looking phone. But I&rsquo;m unsure.</p>

<p>This certainly looks like a good time for Android, with all the quality devices coming out. But it&rsquo;s also a little scary, going out and buying a device only to find a better one released a couple weeks later.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my carrier, T-Mobile, is certainly getting the shaft in terms of new, quality devices. I can only hope this Galaxy comes out in July for T-Mobile, and turns out to be as great as it&rsquo;s hyped up to be.</p>
