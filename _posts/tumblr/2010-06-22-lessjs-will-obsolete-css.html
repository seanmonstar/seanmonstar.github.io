<a href="http://fadeyev.net/2010/06/19/lessjs-will-obsolete-css/">Less.js Will Obsolete CSS</a><br/><p>I&rsquo;m starting to really like the idea of writing <em>less</em> CSS. Especially with all the browser-prefixed properties. It&rsquo;d be nice to just write one <code>border-radius</code> and have a processor expand it for me.</p>

<p>Less looks promising. Though I&rsquo;m hesitant about having the processor execute on the client side. It does cache itself in <code>localStorage</code> if the browser supports it. But what about ones that don&rsquo;t (all of IE)? IE doesn&rsquo;t have a blazing fast JavaScript interpreter to begin with.</p>

<p><strong>Plus</strong>: Every single visitor must spend CPU cycles processing the LessCSS. When the exact same output will be reached every time, I would rather just do it once server side and then serve up a static CSS file. Processed once, cached by <em>all</em> browsers.</p>
