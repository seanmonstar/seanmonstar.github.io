<a href="http://www.marco.org/725288444">Rambling about Verizon</a><br/><blockquote>
  <p>Appleâ€™s quickly losing ground to Android today for only one reason: the majority of mobile-phone owners in the U.S. (the majority of people in the U.S.) choose their network first and their phone second.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I absolutely agree. I would love to have an iPhone, but not at the expense of a crappy network. And since Android and iPhone are comparable (<em>at least to me</em>), that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll be using an Android. It&rsquo;s also why my wife got an Android. And my in-laws. They didn&rsquo;t want to switch networks, so when they saw the Android in store, went with it (<em>and they enjoy it very much</em>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every month without a Verizon iPhone costs Apple dearly in marketshare and mindshare. The longer they wait, the lower their chances to reclaim the difference.</p>
