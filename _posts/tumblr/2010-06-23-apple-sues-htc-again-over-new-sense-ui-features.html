<a href="http://androidandme.com/2010/06/news/apple-sues-htc-again-over-new-sense-ui-features/">Apple sues HTC again over new Sense UI features</a><br/><p>We remember Apple&rsquo;s first lawsuit against HTC. HTC responded in kind by suing for Apple&rsquo;s own infringements on HTC patents.</p>

<p>Apparently, Apple isn&rsquo;t done with the patent game. Now, they must sue for an extremely vague patent:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>System for real-time adaptation to changes in display configuration</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way HTC infringed? By allowing users to see all of their homescreens zoomed out. Something non-existent on the iPhone.</p>

<p>If only these companies could be content with trying to win based on a quality product alone.</p>
