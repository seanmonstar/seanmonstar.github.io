<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/06/23/html5-native-third-ie9-platform-preview-available-for-developers.aspx">Hardware Accelerated Canvas on IE9</a><br/><p>So IE is starting to look semi-competent. And yet, it&rsquo;s still slower than Chrome. And Opera.</p>

<p>Plus, the world won&rsquo;t upgrade. <strong>This version is an operating system upgrade too late</strong>. It would have been far better news if IE9 was installed by default in Windows 7.</p>
