[Hardware Accelerated Canvas on IE9](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2010/06/23/html5-native-third-ie9-platform-preview-available-for-developers.aspx)  

So IE is starting to look semi-competent. And yet, it’s still slower than Chrome. And Opera.

Plus, the world won’t upgrade. **This version is an operating system upgrade too late**. It would have been far better news if IE9 was installed by default in Windows 7.
