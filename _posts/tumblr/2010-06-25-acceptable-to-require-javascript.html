<a href="http://mondaybynoon.com/2010/06/21/is-it-now-acceptable-to-require-javascript/">Is it Now Acceptable to Require JavaScript?</a><br/><p>Regarding web apps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The groundwork has been laid by some of the best thinkers in our industry, and neglecting to build a proper stack, to me, pushes all of that hard work aside in favor of (too) rapid deployment. If you’re metrics show a 99% JavaScript enabled audience, are you willing to forsake that 1%?</p>

<p>Certainly, it&rsquo;s unacceptable for content based sites (<em>brochure sites, blogs, etc</em>) to require JavaScript. But he&rsquo;s talking about more powerful, interactive web applications, like MobileMe and GMail. I&rsquo;d agree that if the content <em>can be reasonbly accessible without JavaScript</em>, it should be. I&rsquo;d say its borderline with GMail, but they do it. Props to them.</p>

<p>Like he says though, some applications <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/2023/2008-07-23-sproutcore-standards-stupid/">exist for exactly what you can do with JavaScript enabled</a>. Such as Blazonco, where what we&rsquo;re offering is the ability to drag and drop your content. That&rsquo;s one of <strong>the</strong> reasons to use it. So should we offer the ability to edit your page without it? I don&rsquo;t see a user-friendly solution of converting draggable components into a mobile-friendly text block.</p>
