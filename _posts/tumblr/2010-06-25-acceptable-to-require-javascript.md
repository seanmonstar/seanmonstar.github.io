[Is it Now Acceptable to Require JavaScript?](http://mondaybynoon.com/2010/06/21/is-it-now-acceptable-to-require-javascript/)  

Regarding web apps:

> The groundwork has been laid by some of the best thinkers in our industry, and neglecting to build a proper stack, to me, pushes all of that hard work aside in favor of (too) rapid deployment. If you’re metrics show a 99% JavaScript enabled audience, are you willing to forsake that 1%?

Certainly, it’s unacceptable for content based sites (_brochure sites, blogs, etc_) to require JavaScript. But he’s talking about more powerful, interactive web applications, like MobileMe and GMail. I’d agree that if the content _can be reasonbly accessible without JavaScript_, it should be. I’d say its borderline with GMail, but they do it. Props to them.

Like he says though, some applications [exist for exactly what you can do with JavaScript enabled](http://seanmonstar.com/2022/07/28/2008-07-23-sproutcore-standards-stupid.html). Such as Blazonco, where what we’re offering is the ability to drag and drop your content. That’s one of **the** reasons to use it. So should we offer the ability to edit your page without it? I don’t see a user-friendly solution of converting draggable components into a mobile-friendly text block.
