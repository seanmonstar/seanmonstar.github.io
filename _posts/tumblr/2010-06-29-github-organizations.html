<a href="http://github.com/blog/674-introducing-organizations">Github Organizations</a><br/><p>This is super good news. Previously, an organization&rsquo;s code was just another user. You&rsquo;d need to login as that user to manage their stuff.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/kamicane/status/17385569319">Good news</a> for <a href="http://github.com/mootools">MooTools</a> also, since all Open Source projects can convert into an organization for free.</p>
