  <p>Hulu Plus is a new, revolutionary <em>ad-supported</em> subscription product that is incremental and complementary to the existing Hulu service. <em>[Emphasis mine]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hulu is fantastic. Besides being able to watch an episode whenever I want, it was because they had bearable advertising. They&rsquo;ve been slowly increasing the number of ads and length, though. And that&rsquo;s a problem. TV ads currently are too disruptive. Hulu was like <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/whats-new.html#reader">Safari Reader</a> for the TV shows.</p>

<p>But if I&rsquo;m going to pay a subscription fee, mostly to watch it through my Xbox, which already requires an Xbox Live subscription, <strong>I better not get ads</strong>. They&rsquo;re only going to get worse and worse.</p>
