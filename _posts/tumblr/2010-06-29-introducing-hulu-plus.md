[Introducing Hulu Plus](http://blog.hulu.com/2010/06/29/introducing-hulu-plus-more-wherever-more-whenever-than-ever/)  

> Hulu Plus is a new, revolutionary _ad-supported_ subscription product that is incremental and complementary to the existing Hulu service. _[Emphasis mine]_

Hulu is fantastic. Besides being able to watch an episode whenever I want, it was because they had bearable advertising. They’ve been slowly increasing the number of ads and length, though. And that’s a problem. TV ads currently are too disruptive. Hulu was like [Safari Reader](http://www.apple.com/safari/whats-new.html#reader) for the TV shows.

But if I’m going to pay a subscription fee, mostly to watch it through my Xbox, which already requires an Xbox Live subscription, **I better not get ads**. They’re only going to get worse and worse.
