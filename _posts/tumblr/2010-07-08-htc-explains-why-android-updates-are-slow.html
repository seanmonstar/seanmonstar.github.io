The only phone to get updates as soon as Google has finished them is the Nexus One. Everyone else waits around while the manufacturers take time to slap on their silly custom UIs<sup id="fnref:p786009262-1"><a href="#fn:p786009262-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>One of the commentors had a good idea: <a href="http://androidandme.com/2010/07/news/htc-explains-why-android-updates-are-slow-custom-uis/#comment-44479">make the custom UIs as downloadable Home replacement apps.</a></p>

<p>The scary thing, which you <em>know</em> is reality:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And, it should be noted that it probably takes HTC so long for some phones since they release so many different variations. They would need multiple teams working on multiple phones – I’m sure they choose the “hottest” phones to work on first. Work on he ones that are still selling and can earn you money… then work on their older (?) phones. Problem is… when you make so many phones on so many networks – your chances of being left in the cold with updates is quite large. HTC, unfortunately, will have to place more and more phones on the backburner for updates – or hire a ridiculous number of programmers to work on phones that don’t sell as much anymore.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t see why they even bother. They&rsquo;re hardware companies, providing custom software. I personally find stock Android to be perfectly fine and usable. <a href="#fnref:p786009262-1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
