<a href="http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/7/Writing-Testable-JavaScript">Writing Testable JavaScript</a><br/><p>Some good advice about singletons, since their popular with the Module Pattern. Also true about &ldquo;tight&rdquo; functions, but this is true in any language.</p>

<p>However, I&rsquo;d ignore the tip to not use private functions just so their testable. That argument doesn&rsquo;t fly in any other language, and the only thing the rest of your program cares about is that the public interface does what it says it does. That&rsquo;s the point of unit testing: <strong>guaranteeing the public API contract.</strong></p>
