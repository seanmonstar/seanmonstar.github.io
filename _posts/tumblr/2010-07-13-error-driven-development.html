<p>If you write software, you write bugs. And after those bugs, there&rsquo;s still errors that will happen in code you didn&rsquo;t get to touch. Errors happen. That&rsquo;s not new. And users know that things can go wrong sometimes. What pains me, is that we know exactly what went wrong, and we don&rsquo;t translate that for the user.</p>

<h3>In Windows</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s surprising to find how often you&rsquo;ll find an error message that&rsquo;s only helpful to the creator of the original system. So often as user, you can reliably create a certain error to happen, and the only message you get back from the program is something like <code>Error 0x2211108: Don't do that</code>. If we as software engineers would just take the time to make sure that every error shown to a user let them know what happened (if its useful, which it actually very often is), and <strong>any steps they can take to fix the error</strong>.</p>

<p>Some of the most terrible error message design is the infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSOD">blue screen of death</a>. It completely disrupts the computer (which could be acceptable, some fatal errors can&rsquo;t be recovered from). But worse, it tells the user virtually <strong>nothing</strong> useful. Just a bunch of computer gibberish.</p>

<p>Disregarding how ugly the error looks, the Windows team could have at least intercepted the error and displayed a useful message. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

<h3>In Blazonco</h3>

<p>A while ago, I went through and documented many of the errors that errors that might bubble up in Blazonco. We&rsquo;ve created a help page for each error, which depends on its unique error code number. I also tried to make sure that all errors are in a language the user understands. Error codes mean nothing to most people, so we don&rsquo;t display them. They&rsquo;re only in the link that the user can click to learn more about<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. They don&rsquo;t need to see that I tried to reference a property of a null object, or that file system threw an error about permissions. Instead, I tried to catch all those, and throw a much <em>prettier</em> error.</p>

<p>We basically have a <code>try/catch</code> at the top most function of our application, which will try to show the error message in a graceful way (inside that little error popover). But it&rsquo;s not in that top function where we convert gibberish into English. It&rsquo;s done whereever a proper error could happen.</p>

<pre><code>$post = new BlogPost;
//...
try {
    $post-&gt;save();
catch (PDOException $ex) {
    if($ex-&gt;getCode() == UNIQUE_CONFLICT_ERROR) {
        throw new BlogPostException('You already have a blog post with that URL. You will need to use a different one so people can view your post.', 40006023);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We still throw an exception, because an error did exist, but we can show much more meaning knowing that it&rsquo;s a <code>BlogPostException</code>, and the message is much more meaningful to the user than what the SQLSTATE would have said.</p>

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>We also <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/04/exception-driven-development.html">log</a> all errors that occur. That way, each morning, I can open up our Superadmin and see if a user has ran into an unexpected internal error, or if a lot of users are receiving an &ldquo;excepted&rdquo; error too often, suggesting a flaw in the UI. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
