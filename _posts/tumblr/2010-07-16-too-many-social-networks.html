<p>I can&rsquo;t help but feel like I&rsquo;m getting overloaded with the number of social networks I&rsquo;m involved in. Granted, I know I&rsquo;m not even in as many as I could be (and some people <em>like</em> being in <em>more</em>). I put this list together more to explain to myself why I should bother using any of these services.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://seanmonstar.com"><strong>Blog</strong></a>: This is where I write my articles about stuff I care about, like programming, Android, and the web. As much as I hated English class throughout my schooling, I&rsquo;ve found it&rsquo;s enjoyable to write my opinion down. It&rsquo;s especially enjoyable when other people notice, but that&rsquo;s a bonus.</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/seanmonstar"><strong>Twitter</strong></a>: With the 140 character cap, this is where I write pretty much anything that fits. If it fits here, I don&rsquo;t blog about it. So it tends to be related to JavaScript, technology, the web, or video games. I don&rsquo;t filter my tweets as much as I do my blog posts.</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/seanmonstar"><strong>Github</strong></a>: This is where I put any code that is open source (<em>duh!</em>). It&rsquo;s useful because of it&rsquo;s integration with the MooTools Forge, so I keep my MooTools plugins here. It&rsquo;s, of course, also great because how easy it is to work with other people on code projects. And I particularly like discussing code commits in the MooTools repositories.</li>
<li><strong>Forrst</strong>: I&rsquo;ve just recently signed up here, but I get the feeling it&rsquo;s going to be kind of like Github, with the whole code sharing, but with a mix of a Twitter, where you can ask for input from a wider range of people. And it can be only an idea, not a commit. Seems like the fun side, whereas Github is more business.</li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/101059/seanmonstar"><strong>StackOverflow</strong></a>: I love learning things. I&rsquo;m addicted to information. So, naturally, I love reading about how to solve interesting problems with code. Some of my favorite stuff is actually in the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/algorithm">algorithms tag</a>. And now I&rsquo;m screwed since they added <a href="http://chat.meta.stackoverflow.com">Chat</a>!</li>
<li><strong>Facebook</strong>: Honestly, I don&rsquo;t think I get anything out of Facebook. I&rsquo;m <strong>only</strong> apart of it because my real life friends use it. And even then, I don&rsquo;t feel I learn anything from using it. Just a bunch of Farmville updates and updates with no surrounding subject. At least on Twitter, I can pick what&rsquo;s in my stream by only following people with the same interests. Often times, I wish I would just take the step and quit. The privacy issues Facebook faces only pushes me harder.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/sean.monstar#buzz"><strong>Buzz</strong></a>: I use this because it&rsquo;s right there staring at me in my GMail. But even then, I don&rsquo;t click the Buzz button to post something. Instead, I figured I&rsquo;d link my &ldquo;Shared Items&rdquo; with my Buzz account. Not because Buzz is bad, though. Buzz is quite decent, it&rsquo;s just a matter of who came to market first in this one. I have followers and people I follow on Twitter, not in GMail.</li>
<li><a href="http://linkedin.com/in/seanmcarthur"><strong>LinkedIn</strong></a>: I have no idea why I keep my account here, either. I started it when I began freelancing a couple years ago, since I thought it would be a good networking tool to get me more jobs. It turns out, it&rsquo;s really good for being spammed by recruiters.</li>
</ul>
