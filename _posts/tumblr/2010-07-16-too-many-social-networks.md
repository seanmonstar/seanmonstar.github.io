I can’t help but feel like I’m getting overloaded with the number of social networks I’m involved in. Granted, I know I’m not even in as many as I could be (and some people _like_ being in _more_). I put this list together more to explain to myself why I should bother using any of these services.

- [**Blog**](http://seanmonstar.com): This is where I write my articles about stuff I care about, like programming, Android, and the web. As much as I hated English class throughout my schooling, I’ve found it’s enjoyable to write my opinion down. It’s especially enjoyable when other people notice, but that’s a bonus.
- [**Twitter**](http://twitter.com/seanmonstar): With the 140 character cap, this is where I write pretty much anything that fits. If it fits here, I don’t blog about it. So it tends to be related to JavaScript, technology, the web, or video games. I don’t filter my tweets as much as I do my blog posts.
- [**Github**](http://github.com/seanmonstar): This is where I put any code that is open source (_duh!_). It’s useful because of it’s integration with the MooTools Forge, so I keep my MooTools plugins here. It’s, of course, also great because how easy it is to work with other people on code projects. And I particularly like discussing code commits in the MooTools repositories.
- **Forrst** : I’ve just recently signed up here, but I get the feeling it’s going to be kind of like Github, with the whole code sharing, but with a mix of a Twitter, where you can ask for input from a wider range of people. And it can be only an idea, not a commit. Seems like the fun side, whereas Github is more business.
- [**StackOverflow**](http://stackoverflow.com/users/101059/seanmonstar): I love learning things. I’m addicted to information. So, naturally, I love reading about how to solve interesting problems with code. Some of my favorite stuff is actually in the [algorithms tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/algorithm). And now I’m screwed since they added [Chat](http://chat.meta.stackoverflow.com)!
- **Facebook** : Honestly, I don’t think I get anything out of Facebook. I’m **only** apart of it because my real life friends use it. And even then, I don’t feel I learn anything from using it. Just a bunch of Farmville updates and updates with no surrounding subject. At least on Twitter, I can pick what’s in my stream by only following people with the same interests. Often times, I wish I would just take the step and quit. The privacy issues Facebook faces only pushes me harder.
- [**Buzz**](http://www.google.com/profiles/sean.monstar#buzz): I use this because it’s right there staring at me in my GMail. But even then, I don’t click the Buzz button to post something. Instead, I figured I’d link my “Shared Items” with my Buzz account. Not because Buzz is bad, though. Buzz is quite decent, it’s just a matter of who came to market first in this one. I have followers and people I follow on Twitter, not in GMail.
- [**LinkedIn**](http://linkedin.com/in/seanmcarthur): I have no idea why I keep my account here, either. I started it when I began freelancing a couple years ago, since I thought it would be a good networking tool to get me more jobs. It turns out, it’s really good for being spammed by recruiters.
