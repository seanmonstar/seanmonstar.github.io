<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/22/google-chrome-versions/">A New Version Of Google Chrome Now Due Every Six Weeks</a><br/><p>I already love Chrome. I try to convince relatives and friends to use it. I managed to convince my <a href="http://tractorbeamtuesdays.tumblr.com">brother</a> to move from Netscape to Chrome.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the new release schedule, even if something isnâ€™t ready to go in one release, it will only be six weeks until it makes the next one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And now, it&rsquo;s going to get better, more often. How could you pick another browser in this current market?</p>
