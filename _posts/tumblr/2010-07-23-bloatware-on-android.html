When I hit the applications drawer, there are more crapware apps that came pre-installed than there are apps that I&rsquo;ve downloaded so far.</p>

<p>This has to be one of maybe two complaints I have of the phone. But even then, this feels true:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I suspect that a lot of operators think consumers won&rsquo;t notice or get to a point where they would want to get rid of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s true. I really don&rsquo;t notice that much. I rarely pop open the 
 applications drawer. All the apps I use even once a week are on one of my wall pages. The apps aren&rsquo;t running unless I start them up, so they aren&rsquo;t using up my precious CPU cycles. And they don&rsquo;t launch &ldquo;reminder&rdquo; notifications that I should check them out. They just take up space, both on my internal <strong>16GB</strong> memory, and in my applications drawer.</p>
