[Bloatware creeps into Android phones](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2010/07/bloatware-creeps-into-android-phones.ars)  

It’s not so much a creeping, and more of **a smashing down the door** , in the case of my new Galaxy. When I hit the applications drawer, there are more crapware apps that came pre-installed than there are apps that I’ve downloaded so far.

This has to be one of maybe two complaints I have of the phone. But even then, this feels true:

> I suspect that a lot of operators think consumers won’t notice or get to a point where they would want to get rid of them.

It’s true. I really don’t notice that much. I rarely pop open the applications drawer. All the apps I use even once a week are on one of my wall pages. The apps aren’t running unless I start them up, so they aren’t using up my precious CPU cycles. And they don’t launch “reminder” notifications that I should check them out. They just take up space, both on my internal **16GB** memory, and in my applications drawer.

And even then, [rooting](http://samsungvibranthacks.com/samsung-vibrant-hacks/how-to-root-samsung-vibrant-galaxy-s/) the Samsung Galaxy S phones is a [breeze](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsoXdhfnHmg).
