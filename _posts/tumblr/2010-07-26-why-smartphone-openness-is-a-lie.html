It&rsquo;s a decent piece of hardware. I heavily debated with myself if it was the device I wanted for my personal use, but I ultimately decided on Android.</p>

<p>One reason is because Android phones are more open. So when I read crap like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bottom line, on a truly “open” Android device, you can’t even make a phone call</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All I see is an Apple fanboy who must bash on Android because so many of us enjoy that Android is more open. I don&rsquo;t care if everything is entirely open. What I care is that I don&rsquo;t have an <a href="http://apple.com">overlord</a> telling me what I can and cannot do with the device I own.</p>

<p>Any complaints I&rsquo;ve seen are about the Droid X, and they&rsquo;ve been cried as if it&rsquo;s a problem in all of Android. I call <strong>bah-log-na</strong>.</p>
