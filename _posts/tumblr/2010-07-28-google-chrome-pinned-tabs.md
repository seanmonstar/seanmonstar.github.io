[Google Chrome Pinned Tabs](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7264/make-google-chrome-open-with-pinned-tabs/)  

This has been in Chrome for a while, but [I just noticed](http://twitter.com/seanmonstar/status/19693854510) it because of [Firefox’s App Tabs](http://lifehacker.com/5597893/firefox-4-beta-2-adds-app-tabs-for-keep+open-sites). You can right click a tab and “Pin” it. To make it open that way every time you start Chrome just requires modifying the Chrome application shortcut.

**Update** : Considering how fast Chrome updates, this is already old. Now all you have to do is pin a tab, and it will stay pinned. Modifying your shortcut no longer does this.
