[How to Turn Your Android Phone into a Fully-Automated Superphone](http://lifehacker.com/5599116/how-to-turn-your-android-phone-into-a-fully+automated-superphone)  

Make your Android phone automatically do a bunch stuff for you. Like turn on GPS when you open Maps. Turn on Silent Mode when you’re at work. Start up your todo list for you in the morning. Automatically turn on WiFi when home, and turn off when you leave.

**It’s awesome.**
