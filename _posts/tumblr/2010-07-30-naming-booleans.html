<p>Naming variables is important stuff. Besides the classic &ldquo;classes should be nouns, methods should be verbs&rdquo; stuff, I find another very common naming convention I use is in naming my Booleans.</p>

<p>Particulary, I like to name them so they are a question. You can read the name of the variable, and feel you were asking a question about some object. And the question <strong>must</strong> be a yes/no question for it to work. No <code>howAreYou</code> variables. I make sure that it truly does sound like a question. I don&rsquo;t like using single word adjectives or adverbs, like <code>running</code> or <code>recommends</code>. I&rsquo;ll add <code>is</code> or <code>has</code> to make it sound like a question.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<pre><code>server.isRunning
book.isRecommended
dog.canBark
table.shouldReplace
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s much easier to tell by looking at them that they are boolean values. Whereas, something like <code>item.likes</code> could actually be a number, of how many people liked the item. <code>item.isLiked</code> tells me that something liked the item. <strong>It&rsquo;s going to be a yes or no answer to my boolean question.</strong></p>
