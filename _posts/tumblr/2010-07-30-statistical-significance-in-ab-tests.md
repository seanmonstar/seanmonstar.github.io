[Statistical Significance & Other A/B Test Pitfalls](http://www.cennydd.co.uk/2009/statistical-significance-other-ab-test-pitfalls/)  

> Last week I tossed a coin a hundred times. 49 heads. Then I changed into a red t-shirt and tossed the same coin another hundred times. 51 heads. From this, I conclude that wearing a red shirt gives a 4.1% increase in conversion in throwing heads.

Put that way, youâ€™d scoff that obviously chance and randomness cause the variation. We should keep that in mind when the variation is small. Especially if the test sample is small.
