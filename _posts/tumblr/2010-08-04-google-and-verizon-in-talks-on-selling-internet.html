<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/technology/05secret.html?pagewanted=all">Google and Verizon in Talks on Selling Internet Priority</a><br/><blockquote>
  <p>The charges could be paid by companies, like YouTube, owned by Google, for example, to Verizon, one of the nationâ€™s leading Internet service providers, to ensure that its content received priority as it made its way to consumers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What!</strong> So if I&rsquo;m downloading something from someone (lets pick Hulu, or Netflix, or Fileplanet) who hasn&rsquo;t paid Verizon&rsquo;s extra fee, I&rsquo;ll get my content slower than Youtubers?</p>

<p>Worse, my general internet browsing will be slowed almost certainly, since I mostly read small blogs.</p>
