[Google and Verizon in Talks on Selling Internet Priority](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/technology/05secret.html?pagewanted=all)  

> The charges could be paid by companies, like YouTube, owned by Google, for example, to Verizon, one of the nation’s leading Internet service providers, to ensure that its content received priority as it made its way to consumers.

**What!** So if I’m downloading something from someone (lets pick Hulu, or Netflix, or Fileplanet) who hasn’t paid Verizon’s extra fee, I’ll get my content slower than Youtubers?

Worse, my general internet browsing will be slowed almost certainly, since I mostly read small blogs.
