  <p>It is up to the author (or site owner) to make themselves known, not the platform. Tumblr offers a description element as well as pages to share more about yourself. In many authors donâ€™t take the time to do so, we cannot fault Tumblr.</p>

<p>Because Tumblr has such a lower barrier to entry for people wanting to blog, you&rsquo;re going to have more people on Tumblr that aren&rsquo;t as informed about the internet. They won&rsquo;t always know proper etiquette, like image attribution, nor are they as likely to be trying to sell themselves.</p>

<p>Whereas those people who do bother with the work of registering a domain, paying for hosting, and installing Wordpress are most likely people who want to sell their name. So of course, you&rsquo;ll find more of those people who bother to make an About Me page.</p>

<p>Tumblr doesn&rsquo;t stop you, or get in the way at all from making an <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/about">About</a> page. It&rsquo;s just that many on Tumblr aren&rsquo;t as learned as we are. All it takes is some mild instruction for them to either care or not.</p>
