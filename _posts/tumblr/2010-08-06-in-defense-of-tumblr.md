[In Defense Of [Tumblr]](http://log.chrisbowler.com/post/909434670/in-defense-of)

> It is up to the author (or site owner) to make themselves known, not the platform. Tumblr offers a description element as well as pages to share more about yourself. In many authors don’t take the time to do so, we cannot fault Tumblr.

> images are very often posted without attribution to the original source

Because Tumblr has such a lower barrier to entry for people wanting to blog, you’re going to have more people on Tumblr that aren’t as informed about the internet. They won’t always know proper etiquette, like image attribution, nor are they as likely to be trying to sell themselves.

Whereas those people who do bother with the work of registering a domain, paying for hosting, and installing Wordpress are most likely people who want to sell their name. So of course, you’ll find more of those people who bother to make an About Me page.

Tumblr doesn’t stop you, or get in the way at all from making an [About](http://seanmonstar.com/about) page. It’s just that many on Tumblr aren’t as learned as we are. All it takes is some mild instruction for them to either care or not.
