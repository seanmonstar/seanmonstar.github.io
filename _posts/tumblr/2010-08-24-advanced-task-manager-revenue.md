[Advanced Task Manager Revenue](http://arronla.com/2010/08/android-revenue-advanced-task-manager/)  

> Android is a viable revenue stream. Although $80,000 total isn’t a lot compared to some of the overnight millionaire stories you hear about on the iPhone App Store (not sure if this is before or after Apple’s cut), you are able to generate good returns. On average, I’m getting around $10,000 a month after all cuts.

Something as simple yet useful as a Task Manager can make $10k a month. On Android. It’s interesting too how much of that is from the free, ad-supported version.
