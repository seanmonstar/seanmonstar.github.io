  <p>Bloggers, as we writers who produce work primarily for an online audience are called, often are quick to write and lazy to edit. I am certainly guilty of this more often than not. Perhaps it is the immediacy of the publishing instrument we use. Perhaps it is a more forgiving audience that has far more important things to do then shoot you a typo correction or critique of style. That said, I often go back to look at pieces I have written in the past. If I see a typo, I correct it. If I see a way I could have said something better, I do so.</p>

<p>It can be fun to open up an old article and read it, since it&rsquo;s no longer fresh in your mind. Often times, I&rsquo;ll find all sorts of spelling and grammatical errors that I just have to fix. Like Patrick says, a smaller number of people will see the article after it&rsquo;s fixed, but at least it&rsquo;s <em>better</em>.</p>
