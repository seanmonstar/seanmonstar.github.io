<a href="http://stylebot.me/">Stylebot</a><br/><p>This is a <em>fantastic</em> extension for Chrome. This lets you easily edit the styles of a web page, and have them be saved and applied next time you visit.</p>

<p>The demo shows one excellent use: improving a site you frequent. I did that for Kotaku/Lifehacker. I never use the Share box, and always mistake it for a search box. So, share box hidden, search box moved into place.</p>

<p>Also, I have refrained from Adblockers in the past because I don&rsquo;t want to block <em>all</em> ads. I respect websites&rsquo; needs to make money. But I don&rsquo;t respect the need to make a website that is more about the ads than the content. So, certain websites that <a href="https://twitter.com/seanmonstar/status/22122514533">cover their articles in flash ads</a>, or have <em>far too many</em> ads in the sidebar, have their ads hidden.</p>

<p>Yes, I know. Shame on me, etc.</p>
