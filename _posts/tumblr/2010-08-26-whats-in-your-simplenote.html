<a href="http://minimalmac.com/post/1014631828/whats-in-your-simplenote">What's in your Simplenote?</a><br/><p>It&rsquo;s always cool to learn new systems to productivity and work. Patrick Rhone asks people to share what they keep in their <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com">Simplenote</a>, and so I join in:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Blog Post Drafts</strong> - Ideas hit me at random times. So I&rsquo;ll start writing, sometimes at lunch time, or waiting outside the dressing room like a loyal husband, or at midnight after reading from Instapaper. Even <em>this</em> post is in my Simplenote.</li>
<li><strong>My Wishlist</strong> - I keep an ordered list of what little things I&rsquo;d like to save up for, one at a time. Current contents include: a second monitor, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UNAX?tag=seanmonstar-20">Carcassonne</a>, and a chess timer.</li>
<li><strong>Brainstorming Spurts</strong> - When I have an idea for something in the future, I like to keep it with me so I may review it from time to time, and add to it when something more hits me. Such as my current freemium plans for a personal project.</li>
</ul>

<p>I quite like Patrick&rsquo;s <strong>Yay me!</strong> idea, and <a href="http://cptnrandy.tumblr.com/post/1015104666/minimal-mac-whats-in-your-simplenote">Randy&rsquo;s</a> <strong>elevator pitch/bio</strong> idea.</p>
