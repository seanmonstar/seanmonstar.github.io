[What's in your Simplenote?](http://minimalmac.com/post/1014631828/whats-in-your-simplenote)  

It’s always cool to learn new systems to productivity and work. Patrick Rhone asks people to share what they keep in their [Simplenote](http://simplenoteapp.com), and so I join in:

- **Blog Post Drafts** - Ideas hit me at random times. So I’ll start writing, sometimes at lunch time, or waiting outside the dressing room like a loyal husband, or at midnight after reading from Instapaper. Even _this_ post is in my Simplenote.
- **My Wishlist** - I keep an ordered list of what little things I’d like to save up for, one at a time. Current contents include: a second monitor, [Carcassonne](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UNAX?tag=seanmonstar-20), and a chess timer.
- **Brainstorming Spurts** - When I have an idea for something in the future, I like to keep it with me so I may review it from time to time, and add to it when something more hits me. Such as my current freemium plans for a personal project.

I quite like Patrick’s **Yay me!** idea, and [Randy’s](http://cptnrandy.tumblr.com/post/1015104666/minimal-mac-whats-in-your-simplenote) **elevator pitch/bio** idea.
