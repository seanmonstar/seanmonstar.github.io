<p>Chrome started it.</p>

<p>Firefox is following along in version 4. The browser in Android does this too.</p>

<p><strong>There is only one bar to enter text.</strong> You can enter a URL, and it will work as you&rsquo;d expect. Or you can enter some terms, and it will send you to your default search engine.</p>

<p>Google has done the same with the default browser in Android. Apparently, it can be <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/08/23/whereIsTheIphone4Spacebar.html">confusing in the iPhone&rsquo;s Safari</a>.</p>

<p>To think that most users of a browser are going to know the difference between a URL and search term would be wrong thinking. To make users <em>care</em> about the difference, for those that do know it, is not caring about your users. All the users should care about is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can I find what I&rsquo;m looking for? Ah yes, the browser bar. I&rsquo;ll just type what I&rsquo;m looking for here. It will tell me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When will all browsers finally combine the location bar with the search bar?</p>
