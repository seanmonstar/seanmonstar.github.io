<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/09/app_store_guidelines">Updated App Store License Agreement</a><br/><p>Mostly good news. I appreciated some of the casual bullet items at the start of the document, such as not wanting to fill the store with &ldquo;amateur hour&rdquo;.</p>

<p>However, <a href="http://twitter.com/saschasegan/status/24016093103">Sascha Segan</a> expresses the same feeling I get when considering iOS apps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People say Apple is being more transparent, but their top app approval guideline is still &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll use our subjective judgement.&rdquo;</p>
