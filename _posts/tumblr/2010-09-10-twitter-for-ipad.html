<a href="http://brooksreview.net/2010/09/twitter-ipad-2/">Twitter for iPad</a><br/><p>I got to use Twitter for iPad for a weekend, and I loved it. I loved how smooth and quick it felt going from my stream to a link someone offered, and checking out the person&rsquo;s profile, and then continuing to create more sliding panels looking at his tweets and more.</p>

<p>I can see how it could be frustrating that you can&rsquo;t unselect a tweet, but it doesn&rsquo;t bother me much. I absolutely love, though, that you can view the links without leaving the Twitter client. I find it frustatingly stupid that iOS doesn&rsquo;t let you go &ldquo;back&rdquo; to a previous application if it launches a new one.</p>

<p>As Ben Brooks put it:</p>

  <p>If this is how much they can do on their first try, then there is no telling just what they will be able to do with more time and feedback.</p>
