[Twitter for iPad](http://brooksreview.net/2010/09/twitter-ipad-2/)  

I got to use Twitter for iPad for a weekend, and I loved it. I loved how smooth and quick it felt going from my stream to a link someone offered, and checking out the person’s profile, and then continuing to create more sliding panels looking at his tweets and more.

I can see how it could be frustrating that you can’t unselect a tweet, but it doesn’t bother me much. I absolutely love, though, that you can view the links without leaving the Twitter client. I find it frustatingly stupid that iOS doesn’t let you go “back” to a previous application if it launches a new one.

As Ben Brooks put it:

> If this is how much they can do on their first try, then there is no telling just what they will be able to do with more time and feedback.
