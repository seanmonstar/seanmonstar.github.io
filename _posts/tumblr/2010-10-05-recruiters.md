[Why are technical recruiters so clueless?](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2598-why-are-technical-recruiters-so-clueless)  

DHH wonders if any recruiters actually research us, or if they just blast us with email.

So far, LinkedIn has done a great job of referring these e-mail blasters to offer me terrible jobs at startups with vague descriptions of ruling the world.
