<blockquote>
  <p>In its current state as “exchange for the rest of us” MobileMe seems neither exciting nor ambitious. [&hellip;] And iDisk? Well, that is also collecting dust.</p>

<p>It truly is one of iOS&rsquo; biggest flaws: that lack of painless syncing. Android doesn&rsquo;t have this problem; I&rsquo;ve plugged <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/2010/09/29/samsung-galaxy-vibrant-review.html">my phone</a> into my computer two times, total.</p>

<p>While I feel that any developer making an application that uses data that could be accessed anywhere should build their own cloud service<sup id="fnref:p1250210395-1"><a href="#fn:p1250210395-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, Android provides this to mobile developers who don&rsquo;t know much about servers. You can use a <code>BackupAgent</code> to allow easy re-installation on a new phone, and use <code>addPeriodicSync</code> to sync any data the same way Calendar or Contacts syncs.</p>

<p>Which shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard for most developers. You just need a database, and a simple API to send and receive the data. <a href="#fnref:p1250210395-1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
