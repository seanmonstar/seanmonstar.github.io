[The Potential of MobileMe](http://shawnblanc.net/2010/10/mobileme-potential/)  

Shawn:

> In its current state as “exchange for the rest of us” MobileMe seems neither exciting nor ambitious. […] And iDisk? Well, that is also collecting dust.

It truly is one of iOS’ biggest flaws: that lack of painless syncing. Android doesn’t have this problem; I’ve plugged [my phone](http://seanmonstar.com/2022/07/28/2010-09-29-samsung-galaxy-vibrant-review.html) into my computer two times, total.

While I feel that any developer making an application that uses data that could be accessed anywhere should build their own cloud service<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, Android provides this to mobile developers who don’t know much about servers. You can use a `BackupAgent` to allow easy re-installation on a new phone, and use `addPeriodicSync` to sync any data the same way Calendar or Contacts syncs.

Which shouldn’t be too hard for most developers. You just need a database, and a simple API to send and receive the data.&nbsp;[↩︎](#fnref:1)
