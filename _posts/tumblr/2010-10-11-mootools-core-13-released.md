[MooTools Core 1.3 Released](http://mootools.net/blog/2010/10/11/mootools-core-1-3-stable-and-mootools-more-1-3rc/)  

Improved speed, improved API decisions. Lots of hard work and tears went into this. Congratulations to the MooTools team.

I’m hurriedly converting my MVC framework to use 1.3, since it fixes a few issues in IE. I could just require the compat mode, but screw that. If you still want 1.2, you can use the compat yourself.
