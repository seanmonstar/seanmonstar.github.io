<a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/10/windows-phone-7-4">Windows Phone 7 Has Hardware Checklist</a><br/><p>Wired:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each device must feature three standard hardware buttons, for example, and before they can ship with Windows Phone 7, they have to pass a series of tests directed by Microsoft.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will certainly help WP7 to have less segmentation, and keep its brand a bit more uniform. I&rsquo;m uncertain if the way Android allows the hardware to be anything in the world is a good or bad thing. It allows cheaper phones to be made, like the Charm, and still guarantees a decebt web browser, while allowing better phones to exist like my Galaxy.</p>

<p>I do wish Android&rsquo;s &ldquo;hardware&rdquo; buttons were in a consistant order, though.</p>
