<blockquote>
  <p>Cars that don’t need drivers also may not need private owners – since they could be summoned remotely and returned once their journey is complete. Why take on a lease if you can purchase a subscription to a car instead?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What a brilliant idea! My wife and I had both thought that no one would be able to afford these cars for a while; with subscriptions, that would be a non-issue. There would also be less total cars required to be made.</p>
