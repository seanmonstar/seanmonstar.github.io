[Google’s Driverless Cars Subscriptions?](http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/10/12/when-can-consumers-buy-a-google-driverless-car-and-why-would-they/)  

CNN:

> Cars that don’t need drivers also may not need private owners – since they could be summoned remotely and returned once their journey is complete. Why take on a lease if you can purchase a subscription to a car instead?

What a brilliant idea! My wife and I had both thought that no one would be able to afford these cars for a while; with subscriptions, that would be a non-issue. There would also be less total cars required to be made.
