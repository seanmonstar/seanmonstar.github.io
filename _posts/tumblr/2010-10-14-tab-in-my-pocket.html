<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/09/10/Galaxy-Tab-in-my-Pocket">Tab In My Pocket</a><br/><p>Tim Bray reviewing the Galaxy Tab:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is an excellent product. It’s fast, beautiful, useful, responsive, and convenient. If Samsung picks the right price point and channels, they’ll sell a ton.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hopefully, they pick a good price for the WiFi version.</p>

<p>He also notes that his review should be balanced by someone not as biased, since he&rsquo;s an Android evangelist working for Google.</p>
