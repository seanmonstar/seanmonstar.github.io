<a href="http://tv.adobe.com/watch/adc-presents/preview-of-the-edge-prototype-tool-for-html5-/">Edge Prototype</a><br/><p>Adobe has a prototype that acts much like their Flash Pro, but generates HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.</p>

<p>I suspect that this will be used on most brochureware websites in the future, but there will of course still be need for optimized hand-coded solutions until browser rendering and performance is as negligible as native apps.</p>
