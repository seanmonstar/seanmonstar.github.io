<p>I have several objects that show some sort of resource guage, and I find all too often that they lie as much as a doormat.</p>

<p>My car fuel gauge, when filled, goes past Full. Driving for 180 miles brings the tank to &frac34;. Another 50 miles brings it down to &frac14;. The next time I turn on the car, it swears it can&rsquo;t go another mile, until I get to the gas station, and don&rsquo;t even put the maximum gallons back in.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/2010/09/29/samsung-galaxy-vibrant-review.html">phone</a> says that it has full battery for an entire day. When I wake up in the next morning, it&rsquo;s at &frac34; battery. Maybe 8 hours later, and it&rsquo;s letting me know I have 20% left.</p>

<p>The Xbox 360 wireless controller claims to have full battery most of its life. It has four bars to indicate battery life. I&rsquo;ve never seen it show less than 2. The only way I know it is low on battery power is when the controller abruptly shuts off. You can turn it back on right away the first couple times, and it still claims 2 out of 4 bars of power. Yet it insists on dying every 15 minutes after that.</p>

<p>I just wonder, what gives? Why is it that all these gauges like to boast they&rsquo;re almost full for so long, and only at the very end do they warn me (or not) of hitting empty.</p>

<p>Dirty lying scumbags.</p>
