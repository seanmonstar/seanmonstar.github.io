<blockquote>
  <p>Remember that feeling when you first started writing automated code tests and realized that you caught all kinds of errors that would have otherwise snuck into your codebase? That&rsquo;s the exact same feeling you&rsquo;ll have if you write the Readme for your project before you write the actual code.</p>
