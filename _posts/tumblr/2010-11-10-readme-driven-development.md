[Readme Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)  

Tom Preston-Werner:

> Remember that feeling when you first started writing automated code tests and realized that you caught all kinds of errors that would have otherwise snuck into your codebase? That’s the exact same feeling you’ll have if you write the Readme for your project before you write the actual code.
