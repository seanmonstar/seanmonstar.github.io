[PostgreSQL vs MySQL](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Why_PostgreSQL_Instead_of_MySQL_2009)  

Blazonco uses PostgreSQL, rather than the ever popular MySQL. If you’ve ever wondered why some people do that, this is a great read.

A couple key points:

- Postgres consistently has had better data integrity
- Postgres has far superior support for transactions and rollbacks.
- Postgres does better query optimization on different kinds of JOINs.
- MySQL performs COUNT queries faster.
