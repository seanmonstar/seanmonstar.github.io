<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/11/where_are_the_android_killer_apps">The Interwebz is Android's Killer App</a><br/><p>I agree with John that there aren&rsquo;t any exclusive 3rd-party applications available on the Android that would make an iPhone owner jealous. I really wish more developers would create awesome apps for Android.</p>

<p>However, I think some of the things that would make an iPhone owner jealous are actually from Google<sup id="fnref:p1672129772-1"><a href="#fn:p1672129772-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<ul><li>The notification system is so much better than iPhone&rsquo;s. </li>
<li>The integration with cloud services kicks the crap out of MobileMe. And it&rsquo;s free.</li>
<li>Speaking of cloud services, I don&rsquo;t have to plug in and sync my phone to a computer. It&rsquo;s its own device. It syncs with the Interwebz. Magically. With pixie dust.</li>
<li>Chrome to Phone is a great way of quickly moving your browser experience from your desktop to your mobile phone. Marked out a trip in Google Maps? Just Chrome to Phone it, and now you have the directions in the native Maps application, instead of emailing yourself a list of directions.</li>
<li>When the web front for the Android Market launches, after browsing to an app you would like, you can click install, and instead of having to connect your phone to sync over the installed app, your phone will get a prompt through the Interwebz to download the app.</li>

<p>John tries to disqualify that, saying it doesn&rsquo;t provide proof of 3rd-party support. That&rsquo;s true. But in the end, I care more about how much more the whole experience is, not just the 3rd-party experience. <a href="#fnref:p1672129772-1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
