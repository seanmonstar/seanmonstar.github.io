[TechCrunch Likes Nexus S](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/06/google-nexus-s-review/)  

They like it:

> The bottom line is this. If you are an iPhone user this isn’t going to make you switch. If you’re an Android user you will want this phone more than any other. If you’re currently neither, we recommend that you go with the Nexus S. It is better than the iPhone in most ways.
