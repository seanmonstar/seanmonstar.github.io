<a href="http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&bid=828">Fixing Lag: Drakes of Destiny</a><br/><p>I recently found the <a href="http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp">Eve Online developer blog</a>, and find it <em>super</em> interesting.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp">series</a> of articles is about them dealing with the massive load they have to handle in huge fleet battles. Some pretty graphs, and some algorithm analysis. Oh, and they use Python!</p>
