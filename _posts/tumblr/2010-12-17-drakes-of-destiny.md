[Fixing Lag: Drakes of Destiny](http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp?a=blog&bid=828)  

I recently found the [Eve Online developer blog](http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp), and find it _super_ interesting.

This [series](http://www.eveonline.com/devblog.asp) of articles is about them dealing with the massive load they have to handle in huge fleet battles. Some pretty graphs, and some algorithm analysis. Oh, and they use Python!
