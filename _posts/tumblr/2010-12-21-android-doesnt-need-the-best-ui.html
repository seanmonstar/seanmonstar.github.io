<a href="http://www.marco.org/2402097858">Android doesn't need the best UI</a><br/><p>People make statements like this all the time and assume that&rsquo;s the end of the argument right there:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Android is] never going to be Apple-like in user experience, polish, or design.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree that the iPhone is a great product. However, I can also conclude that Android phones are great as well. There are pros and cons to both devices<sup id="fnref:p2409220229-1"><a href="#fn:p2409220229-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Yes, generally, the Apple UI is more pleasing to the eye. I wouldn&rsquo;t say <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2010/08/23/whereIsTheIphone4Spacebar.html">it&rsquo;s clearly more intuitive though</a>.</p>

<p>Regarding the UI: not everyone cares about how perfect the UI is. Sure, designers will care. Even people who are more educated about the design can care. But plenty others won&rsquo;t care. People I know who don&rsquo;t care: me, my wife, my parents, my in-laws, my brother, some of my co-workers. Some of us like Android&rsquo;s pros more than the iPhone&rsquo;s. Others don&rsquo;t care either way.</p>

<p>There are some things I don&rsquo;t think Google will do better than Apple. That&rsquo;s ok. It doesn&rsquo;t make either the absolute best, but depending on your tastes, one or the other might be better <em>for you</em>.</p>

<p>This is also why I try to completely ignore the &ldquo;score&rdquo; that video game blogs try to give to games. What they feel makes a great game isn&rsquo;t necessarily what I feel does. I try to read the reasons why they think its good and bad, and then I can make the choice when they say something like: &ldquo;the gameplay is really fun and unique, but the ladder climbing animation is just ridiculous. In this day and age, I can&rsquo;t give it more than a 5/10.&rdquo; Hey, that&rsquo;s fine. I&rsquo;ll go enjoy the gameplay, and you can ignore it for it&rsquo;s funny yet rarely seen animation. <a href="#fnref:p2409220229-1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
