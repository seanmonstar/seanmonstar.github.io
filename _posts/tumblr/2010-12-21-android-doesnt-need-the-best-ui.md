[Android doesn't need the best UI](http://www.marco.org/2402097858)  

People make statements like this all the time and assume that’s the end of the argument right there:

> [Android is] never going to be Apple-like in user experience, polish, or design.

I agree that the iPhone is a great product. However, I can also conclude that Android phones are great as well. There are pros and cons to both devices<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Yes, generally, the Apple UI is more pleasing to the eye. I wouldn’t say [it’s clearly more intuitive though](http://scripting.com/stories/2010/08/23/whereIsTheIphone4Spacebar.html).

Regarding the UI: not everyone cares about how perfect the UI is. Sure, designers will care. Even people who are more educated about the design can care. But plenty others won’t care. People I know who don’t care: me, my wife, my parents, my in-laws, my brother, some of my co-workers. Some of us like Android’s pros more than the iPhone’s. Others don’t care either way.

There are some things I don’t think Google will do better than Apple. That’s ok. It doesn’t make either the absolute best, but depending on your tastes, one or the other might be better _for you_.

This is also why I try to completely ignore the “score” that video game blogs try to give to games. What they feel makes a great game isn’t necessarily what I feel does. I try to read the reasons why they think its good and bad, and then I can make the choice when they say something like: “the gameplay is really fun and unique, but the ladder climbing animation is just ridiculous. In this day and age, I can’t give it more than a 5/10.” Hey, that’s fine. I’ll go enjoy the gameplay, and you can ignore it for it’s funny yet rarely seen animation.&nbsp;[↩︎](#fnref:1)
