[Understanding Your Battery](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=871051%20)  

Things I learned: keeping the battery plugged in once it’s fully charged isn’t as bad since it stops pulling power between 100%-90%. And, thanks to [Battery University](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries):

> Several partial discharges with frequent recharges are better for lithium-ion than one deep one. Recharging a partially charged lithium-ion does not cause harm because there is no memory.
