Charles Ying:

> Android’s UX architecture needs work. UI compositing and the view system are both primarily done in software. Garbage collection and async operations frequently block UI rendering.

As much as I like Android, this is definitely a low point. It gets rather frustrating when an app doesn’t respond because of some blocking URL request, or a huge amount of garbage collection is happening. I _always_ want the phone to respond to my touch, at the very least.
