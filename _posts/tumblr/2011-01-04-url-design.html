<a href="http://warpspire.com/posts/url-design/">URL Design</a><br/><p>Excellent article by Kyle Neath. Continuing on the subject, <a href="http://ianhin.es/wrote-about/designing-urls-for-humans/">Ian Hines created a nifty structure</a> for his site:</p>

<pre><code>`http://ianhin.es/wrote-about/iphone`
</code></pre>

<p>However, my only concern with such a structure for blogs is what happens when you write about the iPhone again? For blogs, I actually do find the <code>/year/month/slug</code> format to be informative to me. It gives me context: &ldquo;Ok, so its about the iPhone, circa 2 years ago.&rdquo;</p>
