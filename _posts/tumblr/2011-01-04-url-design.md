[URL Design](http://warpspire.com/posts/url-design/)  

Excellent article by Kyle Neath. Continuing on the subject, [Ian Hines created a nifty structure](http://ianhin.es/wrote-about/designing-urls-for-humans/) for his site:

    `http://ianhin.es/wrote-about/iphone`

However, my only concern with such a structure for blogs is what happens when you write about the iPhone again? For blogs, I actually do find the `/year/month/slug` format to be informative to me. It gives me context: “Ok, so its about the iPhone, circa 2 years ago.”
