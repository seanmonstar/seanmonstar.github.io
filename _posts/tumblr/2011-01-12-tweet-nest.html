<a href="http://pongsocket.com/tweetnest/">Tweet Nest</a><br/><p>Really neat looking app to keep a viewable, searchable, and customizable archive of all your tweets. Since, you know, Twitter ditches all old tweets. Personally, I&rsquo;ve setup a tumblr account to pull in all <a href="http://tweets.seanmonstar.com">my tweets</a>, but this definitely looks and functions better. It just costs having your own server.</p>
