<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine a web publishing platform that costs $10 per month.</p>
  
  <p>$5 of that $10 goes to the platform company for the boring stuff.</p>
  
  <p>The other $5 gets split evenly between the writers, photographers, videographers, designers, and other creative people you follow who also pay to use the platform, up to a maximum of — say — 20 followers, hand-picked by you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love it. I couldn&rsquo;t pay $10 a month for every blog I enjoy. But I could pay that to <em>read blogs</em>, period. The people who are good would make fair money.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d make $1.33 a month.</p>
