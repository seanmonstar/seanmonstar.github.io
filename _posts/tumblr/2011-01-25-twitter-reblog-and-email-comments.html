<a href="http://ianhin.es/wrote-about/twitter-reblog-and-email-comments/">Twitter, Reblog, and Email Comments</a><br/><p>The ways that you can comment even when an author doesn&rsquo;t provide you a comment form.</p>

<p>What I particularly like about this is that then, when you use these other means, <em>you</em> own your comments. If you leave comments on someone&rsquo;s blog, <em>they</em> own it.</p>

<p>So, I get to show only the content I want to on <em>my</em> site, and everyone else gets to own their comments.</p>
