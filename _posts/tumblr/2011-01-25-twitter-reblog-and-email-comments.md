[Twitter, Reblog, and Email Comments](http://ianhin.es/wrote-about/twitter-reblog-and-email-comments/)  

The ways that you can comment even when an author doesn’t provide you a comment form.

What I particularly like about this is that then, when you use these other means, _you_ own your comments. If you leave comments on someone’s blog, _they_ own it.

So, I get to show only the content I want to on _my_ site, and everyone else gets to own their comments.
