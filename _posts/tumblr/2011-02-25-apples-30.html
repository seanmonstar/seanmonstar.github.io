<p>Many people seem to <a href="http://brooksreview.net/2011/02/subscriptions-mg/">feel like this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am tired of hearing non-developers whine about this move. The bottom line is that this is the best possible move consumers of iOS devices could have hoped for. [&hellip;] Yes, this gives developers the shaft.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This coming from a non-developer. I think those people in favor of the new model only care that it&rsquo;s easier for them to subscribe in-app. Considering that the reason people like the iOS platform is because of all the 3rd party apps, &ldquo;giving the developers the shaft&rdquo; is not exactly intelligent.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.tightwind.net/2011/02/gruber-apple-doesnt-need-readability-yes-they-do/">Kyle Baxter puts it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gruber’s position is that Apple shouldn’t care, because they don’t “need” Readability. But they most assuredly do, in the aggregate; Apple needs Readability, and Pandora, and Netflix, and Instpaper, and Rdio, and all other businesses put in a precarious position by Apple’s new rules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What many of those in favor of the policy aren&rsquo;t keeping in mind is that the subscription is to pay for the entire service. For many software-as-a-service companies, the iPhone app is just a small part in their overall offering. I&rsquo;m not talking about iOS-only apps. I mean applications that are merely a native client to viewing a larger web app. It costs a lot to offer all the programming, design, customer support, and hosting that they provide. Taking 30 percent for the lifetime of the customer is just greed. It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s free to develop an iOS application, anyways. There&rsquo;s already an Apple tax just to begin. You have to own an Apple computer, an iOS device to test on, and pay a yearly $100 just to be a developer.</p>

<p>What this policy ends up meaning to small independent developers, such as for my own project: Much of the cost is in my development time, and then the server hosting. And my application doesn&rsquo;t even provide my own content, its a way to view others&rsquo; content. It&rsquo;s biggest use case (in my mind) is the website. I would only consider offering an iPhone application as a nicety to iPhone owners. Since my pricing would be fair, I can&rsquo;t imagine offering the services of my application for only 70% the price. In return, all Apple will have given me is a credit card processed.</p>

<p>With that kind of one-sided deal, I&rsquo;m left with simply providing an optimized mobile site. As will many other developers. Then, iOS no longer has a bunch of exclusive content apps; they have a bunch of apps that are equally available on all modern mobile devices. What&rsquo;s more, the experience will likely be <em>better</em> on Android and Windows Phone 7, since we can still provide native clients without being robbed.</p>

<p>No, I don&rsquo;t need Apple. Apple needs all the developers like me.</p>
