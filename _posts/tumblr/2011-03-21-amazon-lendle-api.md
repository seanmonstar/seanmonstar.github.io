[Amazon revokes Lendle's API access](http://lendle.me/amazon-api-revocation/)  

Not very well thought out, Amazon.

My wife has found books she never would have normally tried since the risk was removed by borrowing it. Then, since she can only borrow so many books through Lendle anyways, she went and bought most of the rest of that author’s books. Publishers/authors who don’t see the value in that are truly missing it.
