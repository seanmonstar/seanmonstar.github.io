  <p>Contractors aren’t bad. Contractors are usually sharp-shooters of incredible talent who have to bounce from project to project, never settling into a Primary Skill Set because every project calls for something different. But contractors aren’t in charge of the product the way they are when they write their own software: the client is. Contractors will take as much pride in their work as they can because they don’t want to be known for shipping anything bad, but they’ll always be overruled by The Money.</p>

<p>This is why I&rsquo;ve largely stopped freelancing. When freelancing, you spend your time and talent on an idea that was not thought up with an understanding of what could be accomplished. Nor do you fully love the work, because it&rsquo;s not your baby.</p>
