<blockquote>
  <p>By making an intentional decision to not pursue a real-time schedule with my site it allows me the space to think and breathe and therefore write things which are more thought related than they are time-sensitive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m subscribed to far more feeds where the author write longer opinion pieces, despite likely being irregular. I value well crafted opinion over breaking news. I only need the new &ldquo;broken&rdquo; once. In my experience, if it&rsquo;s important, I&rsquo;ll hear about it somewhere soon enough. If it&rsquo;s not, I didn&rsquo;t need to know about it anyways.</p>

<p>My regularity has greatly dropped since changing jobs, but I as it ebbs and flows, I&rsquo;d rather write the same way. Hopefully, you come here for my opinion. The news is elsewhere.</p>
