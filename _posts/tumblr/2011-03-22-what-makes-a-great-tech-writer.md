[What Makes a Great Tech Writer](http://shawnblanc.net/2011/03/great-tech-writing/)  

Shawn Blanc:

> By making an intentional decision to not pursue a real-time schedule with my site it allows me the space to think and breathe and therefore write things which are more thought related than they are time-sensitive.

It’s why I’m subscribed to far more feeds where the author write longer opinion pieces, despite likely being irregular. I value well crafted opinion over breaking news. I only need the new “broken” once. In my experience, if it’s important, I’ll hear about it somewhere soon enough. If it’s not, I didn’t need to know about it anyways.

My regularity has greatly dropped since changing jobs, but I as it ebbs and flows, I’d rather write the same way. Hopefully, you come here for my opinion. The news is elsewhere.
