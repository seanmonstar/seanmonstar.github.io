[Dictionary Performance, Tries, Oh My](http://ejohn.org/blog/revised-javascript-dictionary-search/)  

This [kind](http://ejohn.org/blog/dictionary-lookups-in-javascript/) of [stuff](http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-trie-performance-analysis/) is far more interesting as a programmer than handling click events to fade in an element. In JavaScript, no less.
