<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/03/are-you-making-something.html">Work and Play Devices</a><br/><p>I work and play from the same computer, and I see no need to add to my load by buying a separate device and enforcing rules on myself.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m working, I have a browser open on one screen, and my text editor in the other. When I&rsquo;m playing, I have a game in full screen mode. I find it quite easy to notice the difference. Hint: the lack of elves indicates work.</p>
