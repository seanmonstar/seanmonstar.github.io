[Work and Play Devices](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/03/are-you-making-something.html)  

I work and play from the same computer, and I see no need to add to my load by buying a separate device and enforcing rules on myself.

When I’m working, I have a browser open on one screen, and my text editor in the other. When I’m playing, I have a game in full screen mode. I find it quite easy to notice the difference. Hint: the lack of elves indicates work.
