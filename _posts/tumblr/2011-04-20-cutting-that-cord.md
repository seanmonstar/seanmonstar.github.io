> That’s where Apple is behind.

I don’t think many people _need_ to be syncing 32 or 64 GB of data wirelessly. Only power users have that much media they want to carry around all the time. And for those power users, I would argue that it would be far more impressive to see 64 GB of your music and video starting to slowly show up on your new device. Trying to view media not yet downloaded would bump it to the front of the queue, and you would be seeing your content in a few seconds. Without being a slave to a PC.

I love the freedom Android makes me feel, and I can’t possibly imagine having to go to a device that requires me to connect to a PC on a regular basis. Computing is just _that_ much better when the cloud is involved. Mmm, fluffy clouds.
