<blockquote>
  <p>The threats accuse devs of patent infringement regarding Appleâ€™s in-app purchase mechanism, but the patent holder appears to be targeting independent developers individually instead of going after Apple itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An example of capitalism, where man exploits man as hard as he can.</p>
