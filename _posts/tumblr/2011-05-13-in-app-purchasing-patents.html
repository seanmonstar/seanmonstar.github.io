<a href="http://gigaom.com/apple/indie-devs-get-hit-with-lawsuit-threats-over-in-app-purchases/">In-App Purchasing Patents</a><br/><p>GigaOm:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The threats accuse devs of patent infringement regarding Apple’s in-app purchase mechanism, but the patent holder appears to be targeting independent developers individually instead of going after Apple itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An example of capitalism, where man exploits man as hard as he can.</p>
