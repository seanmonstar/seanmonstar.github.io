[In-App Purchasing Patents](http://gigaom.com/apple/indie-devs-get-hit-with-lawsuit-threats-over-in-app-purchases/)  

GigaOm:

> The threats accuse devs of patent infringement regarding Appleâ€™s in-app purchase mechanism, but the patent holder appears to be targeting independent developers individually instead of going after Apple itself.

An example of capitalism, where man exploits man as hard as he can.
