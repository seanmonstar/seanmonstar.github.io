[Chromebook](http://www.google.com/chromebook/#chromebooks)  

I’ve got two Cr-48’s, and I [love](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/chrome-os-for-personal-use/) them[^1]. However, I would never spend $500 on one. It’s still just a browser. I can spend $500 on a Windows laptop, and get Chrome, _plus_ a bunch of other software.



[^1]: I must have special touchpads, cause mine work brilliantly.
