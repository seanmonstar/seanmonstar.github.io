[Chromebook](http://www.google.com/chromebook/#chromebooks)  

I’ve got two Cr-48’s, and I [love](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/chrome-os-for-personal-use/) them<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. However, I would never spend $500 on one. It’s still just a browser. I can spend $500 on a Windows laptop, and get Chrome, _plus_ a bunch of other software.
