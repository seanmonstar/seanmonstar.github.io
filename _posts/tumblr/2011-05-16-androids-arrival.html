<blockquote>
  <p>Maybe [Google] realizes that they now have a platform that can stand toe to toe with Apple in a variety of categories. Android isn’t as simple to use and not as elegant, but it’s powerful, functional and has a rabid fan base.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can admit that iOS is more elegant. Thing is, I&rsquo;m all about function before form. Frankly, my Android can just plain do more. Other&rsquo;s are noticing, and Android is growing. Calling it ugly won&rsquo;t stop that.</p>
