[Android’s Arrival](http://carpeaqua.com/2011/05/12/androids-arrival/)  

Justin Williams:

> Maybe [Google] realizes that they now have a platform that can stand toe to toe with Apple in a variety of categories. Android isn’t as simple to use and not as elegant, but it’s powerful, functional and has a rabid fan base.

I can admit that iOS is more elegant. Thing is, I’m all about function before form. Frankly, my Android can just plain do more. Other’s are noticing, and Android is growing. Calling it ugly won’t stop that.
