<blockquote>
  <p>The importance of eating together with your co-workers is not negotiable, to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Working from home, eating lunch with my wife every day is a perk of the job. However, I do value being able to eat with my team when I fly up to Mountain View. I get to argue out my ideas that are too nerdy/technical for my wife. Some decent ideas come from that arguing.</p>
