[Lunch](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2011/04/28.html)

Working from home, eating lunch with my wife every day is a perk of the job. However, I do value being able to eat with my team when I fly up to Mountain View. I get to argue out my ideas that are too nerdy/technical for my wife. Some decent ideas come from that arguing.
