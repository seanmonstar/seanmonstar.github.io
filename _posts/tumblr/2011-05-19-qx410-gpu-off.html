<a href="https://github.com/mkottman/acpi_call">Turn off GPU on QX410</a><br/><p>I use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004B57XTG/?tag=seanmonstar-20">Samsung QX410 laptop</a> when I travel, and when I want to stand while working at my counter. Since it&rsquo;s mostly for development, I run Ubuntu on it.</p>

<p>Sucky thing is, the hybrid Optimus card has no support or love from nVidia on Linux. Since we can&rsquo;t use the thing anyways, this command let&rsquo;s you turn it off, giving you an extra 2-3 hours of battery life. Score.</p>
