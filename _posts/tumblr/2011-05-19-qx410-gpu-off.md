[Turn off GPU on QX410](https://github.com/mkottman/acpi_call)  

I use a [Samsung QX410 laptop](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004B57XTG/?tag=seanmonstar-20) when I travel, and when I want to stand while working at my counter. Since it’s mostly for development, I run Ubuntu on it.

Sucky thing is, the hybrid Optimus card has no support or love from nVidia on Linux. Since we can’t use the thing anyways, this command let’s you turn it off, giving you an extra 2-3 hours of battery life. Score.
