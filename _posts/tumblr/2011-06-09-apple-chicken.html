<a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/06/09/apple-reverses-course-on-in-app-subscriptions/">Apple's Game of Chicken</a><br/><p>Many cheer that Apple finally accepted common sense. What really happened was that Apple lost it&rsquo;s game of chicken versus Amazon, Netflix, et al.</p>

<p>The people who lost the game were those smaller companies who believed Apple wouldn&rsquo;t step down. They closed shop, or complied with Apple&rsquo;s demands, even though Apple didn&rsquo;t mean to carry through (as long as it&rsquo;s big 3rd-party friends didn&rsquo;t give in).</p>
