[Apple's Game of Chicken](http://www.macrumors.com/2011/06/09/apple-reverses-course-on-in-app-subscriptions/)  

Many cheer that Apple finally accepted common sense. What really happened was that Apple lost it’s game of chicken versus Amazon, Netflix, et al.

The people who lost the game were those smaller companies who believed Apple wouldn’t step down. They closed shop, or complied with Apple’s demands, even though Apple didn’t mean to carry through (as long as it’s big 3rd-party friends didn’t give in).
