<a href="http://smokingapples.com/opinion/my-thoughts-on-the-whole-ios-5-copying-android-situation/">Copy Me, and I'll Sue!</a><br/><p>Apple has several <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20110418/apple-files-patent-suit-against-samsung-over-galaxy-line-of-phones-and-tablets/">lawsuits against</a> <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/2010/06/23/apple-sues-htc-again-over-new-sense-ui-features.html">manufacturers</a> of Android phones, essentially saying they copied the iPhone and iOS.</p>

<p>Then, when Apple does the copying, Apple fanatics argue &ldquo;well yea, how else would Apple have made notifications?&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Android had pretty much perfected the notification system. So if Apple had to create a perfect notifications system it was going to be difficult for them to not make it look like the one on Android.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really care when people copy good ideas. I think that copying good ideas is better for consumers. It&rsquo;d just be nice for people to notice the hypocrisy around this.</p>
