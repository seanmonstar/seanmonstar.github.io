[Copy Me, and I'll Sue!](http://smokingapples.com/opinion/my-thoughts-on-the-whole-ios-5-copying-android-situation/)  

Apple has several [lawsuits against](http://allthingsd.com/20110418/apple-files-patent-suit-against-samsung-over-galaxy-line-of-phones-and-tablets/) [manufacturers](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/2010-06-23-apple-sues-htc-again-over-new-sense-ui-features/) of Android phones, essentially saying they copied the iPhone and iOS.

Then, when Apple does the copying, Apple fanatics argue “well yea, how else would Apple have made notifications?”

> Android had pretty much perfected the notification system. So if Apple had to create a perfect notifications system it was going to be difficult for them to not make it look like the one on Android.

I don’t really care when people copy good ideas. I think that copying good ideas is better for consumers. It’d just be nice for people to notice the hypocrisy around this.
