<a href="http://ironjs.wordpress.com/2011/06/22/my-gripes-with-javascript/">Why I pick Python over JavaScript</a><br/><p>I love JavaScript. It&rsquo;s awesome. But this is an excellent view at why I still think Python has a place on the server. Some of the points I share pain with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Very small standard library</li>
<li>Only a single number type (which is limited)</li>
<li>No built in module system</li>
</ul>
