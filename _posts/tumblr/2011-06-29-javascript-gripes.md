[Why I pick Python over JavaScript](http://ironjs.wordpress.com/2011/06/22/my-gripes-with-javascript/)  

I love JavaScript. It’s awesome. But this is an excellent view at why I still think Python has a place on the server. Some of the points I share pain with:

- Very small standard library
- Only a single number type (which is limited)
- No built in module system
