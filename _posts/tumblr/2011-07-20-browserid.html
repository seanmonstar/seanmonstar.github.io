<a href="http://browserid.org">BrowserID</a><br/><p><a href="http://identity.mozilla.com/post/7616727542">Dan Mills</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With BrowserID, there is a better way to sign in. BrowserID implements the /verified email protocol/, which offers a streamlined user experience. A user can prove their ownership of an email address with fewer confirmation messages and without site-specific passwords.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m all in favor of having less passwords. Plus, this also means if the site gets hacked, they don&rsquo;t get any of my credentials. I don&rsquo;t exactly <em>get</em> BrowserID, yet. Until I can use it widespread, <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/2010/06/18/setup-your-own-openid.html">I use OpenID</a> whenever I can.</p>
