[BrowserID](http://browserid.org)  

[Dan Mills](http://identity.mozilla.com/post/7616727542):

> With BrowserID, there is a better way to sign in. BrowserID implements the /verified email protocol/, which offers a streamlined user experience. A user can prove their ownership of an email address with fewer confirmation messages and without site-specific passwords.

I’m all in favor of having less passwords. Plus, this also means if the site gets hacked, they don’t get any of my credentials. I don’t exactly _get_ BrowserID, yet. Until I can use it widespread, [I use OpenID](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/2010-06-18-setup-your-own-openid/) whenever I can.
