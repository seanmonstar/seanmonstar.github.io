<p>I&rsquo;ve been enjoying <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/+">Google+</a>, for the most part. I would love to just drop Twitter and Facebook, since it feels like the proper merging of the two. Besides that most of my friends aren&rsquo;t using it, given some time, I&rsquo;m sure more will. In the meantime, I&rsquo;m using it more along the Twitter approach than the Facebook approach<sup id="fnref:p8159079906-1"><a href="#fn:p8159079906-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>To that effect, there are some things that if added, would make the experience closer to what I feel the Google+ product team was aiming for<sup id="fnref:p8159079906-2"><a href="#fn:p8159079906-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>

<ul><li>Posts should <strong>only show the first 2-3 comments</strong> that I haven&rsquo;t seen yet, with a link to open more. Seriously, some posts are gigantic walls of comments from people that frankly I don&rsquo;t care about.</li>
<li><strong>Circles need a way of letting others join them.</strong> I like talking about JavaScript, Android, Star Wars, and video games. I bet most people who find what I have to say interesting aren&rsquo;t interested in all those subjects. However, I&rsquo;m not going to ask for an email from everyone to let me know what Circle I should put them in. So I end up having to post most things Public, which is contrary to the product goal.</li>
<li><strong>Notifications are super buggy.</strong> Sometimes, it will show I have notifications, but clicking the button from GMail will show that I really don&rsquo;t have anything unread. Sometimes, clicking that button will show the notifications panel, but the contents have duplicated inside the panel. Also, unlike Gmail, which does a great job of syncing my unread notifications between the web client and my Android phone, the Google+ notifications show up on both; no matter what. Turning off syncing the notifications to my phone saved my double dismissal duty, and about half a days worth of battery power.</li>
<li>Sharing needs to let me do <strong>intersections of Circles</strong>, and everyone but a Circle (or persons). Such as, my people that are both in my Local and Starcraft Circles, excluding John.</li>
</ul><p>Some <a href="http://eaves.ca/2011/07/22/why-im-struggling-with-google/">related reading</a> from David Eaves that got me thinking about this.</p>

<p>The Twitter approach is to follow people that interest me, and everything I post is Public. The Facebook approach is putting people into appropriate Circles, and communicating heavily through Circles. <a href="#fnref:p8159079906-1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>

<p>I also think that this wishlist will grow out-of-date very quickly, since the product team seems to be adding useful bits each week. <a href="#fnref:p8159079906-2" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
