[Page Speed Service](http://code.google.com/speed/pss/index.html)  

> Page Speed Service fetches content from your servers, rewrites your pages by applying web performance best practices and serves them to end users via Googleâ€™s servers across the globe.

In some ways kind of creepy, but if genuine, it makes a lot of sense. They can automate compressing assets, gzipping content, and using a CDN. This simple plug-n-play could decrease page loads for a site significantly.
