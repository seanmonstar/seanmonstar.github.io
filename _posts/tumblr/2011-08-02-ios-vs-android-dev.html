<a href="http://nfarina.com/post/8239634061/ios-to-android">An iOS Developer Takes on Android</a><br/><p>An unbiased look at programming for Android, after having programmed for iOS. He gave it a good go, and realized that it&rsquo;s terribleness has been exaggerated.<sup id="fnref:p8392991361-1"><a href="#fn:p8392991361-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>About Eclipse:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’re going to just <em>hate</em> Eclipse. You’re going to hate it with the heat of a thousand suns. [&hellip;] The upside is, after acclimating to Eclipse, you’ll enjoy some seriously amazing, productivity-boosting code completion, refactoring, and automatic fixing. It’ll basically write your code for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Android&rsquo;s View system:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best part is that it’s zero-effort-easy to make layouts that automatically resize for portrait/landscape device orientations and varying screen sizes. This is in stark contrast to the absolutely primitive springs and struts system in Cocoa/iOS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s a true shame about the animation issues, however.</p>
