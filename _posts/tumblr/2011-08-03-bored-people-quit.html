<a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2011/07/12/bored_people_quit.html">Bored People Quit</a><br/><p>I found myself nodding the entire time I read this essay from Michael Lopp. It&rsquo;s filled with truth. An excellent point that I just <em>have</em> to share:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Exploration is hard to justify because it’s hard to measure. When exploration is complete, you often have nothing to hold up to your project manager to explain or justify the expenditure of time. Here’s what you tell them, “My job isn’t just building product; I also build people.”</p>
</blockquote>
