<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/supercharging-android-google-to-acquire.html">Google and Motorola</a><br/><p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve seen else where that Google has bought Motorola. While people are busy talking about the boring patent portfolio that Google gains, I&rsquo;m more interested in this part by Larry Page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Motorolaâ€™s total commitment to Android in mobile devices is one of many reasons that there is a natural fit between our two companies. Together, we will create amazing user experiences that supercharge the entire Android ecosystem for the benefit of consumers, partners and developers everywhere.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Google&rsquo;s Nexus devices are the &ldquo;pure&rdquo; Android experience, and are far better devices for it. With Google now directly controlling how the hardware should match the software, this could mean many more devices that don&rsquo;t get the OEM skin-cruft, and far faster updates. Hopefully we&rsquo;ll see less <a href="http://www.betabeat.com/2011/07/29/why-my-mom-bought-an-android-returned-it-and-got-an-iphone/">devices that make Android look bad</a>.</p>

<p>Also an interesting note, is that Google will now be making money directly related the quality of their software and hardware combination. We&rsquo;ll see how this affects features and the user experience, as opposed to currently, where Google only makes money indirectly through ads in mobile search.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: On the flip side, what if Google offered high quality Motorola phones for super cheap (free after a new contract), eating the cost at having more people having good Android&rsquo;s in their hands? With good, fast devices, there would be more searchs, and more Maps usage. Both would be an increase to places Google could advertise. Just a thought.</p>
