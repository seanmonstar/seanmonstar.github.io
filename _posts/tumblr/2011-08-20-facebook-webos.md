I wanted to weigh in on HP giving up on webOS. First, when HP bought Palm webOS, it’s plan to be able to make it’s very own, unique set of products (phones, tablets, and desktops) all running the same OS, it sounded really appealing. Not that I think it’s necessarily [the wrong move](http://www.splatf.com/2011/08/hp-apple/), but it is too bad they are giving up.

On to webOS’ future. I definitely could see Facebook buying it and using it to make their own phone/tablets. [MG Siegler says it all](http://parislemon.com/post/9092348745):

> They clearly believe in HTML5 and are working towards that future, but at the same time, they need their own mobile OS solution. WebOS would give them the best of both worlds.

Besides saving some effort, since Facebook has been so gun-ho about HTML5, they could spend that effort in making a unique experience. What was unique about the TouchPad? It was _not_ the iPad? Yea, several Android tablets already have that claim, and are much better than the TouchPad.

Facebook could make a tablet what was always logged in<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. With so many websites using Facebook Connect, they could offer the convenient “already logged into the web” experience. You no longer need to remember usernames and passwords, because your tablet will notice Facebook Connect buttons and automatically log you in. You could automatically see comments or likes from your friends, on any page you visited. Perhaps it could be a notification widget in the top, showing you some friends recommend the thing you’re looking at.

It wouldn’t be for everyone, but it sure would be something different, and something worth marketing about.

I hope the platform isn’t [doomed on the software side](https://twitter.com/seanmonstar/status/104292223406972928), but it looks like the TouchPad has similar specs to the iPad, but performs _terribly_. That sounds like software to me.&nbsp;[↩︎](#fnref:1)
