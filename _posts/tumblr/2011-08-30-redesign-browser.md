[Redesigning the Browser Window](http://blogg.antrop.se/interaktionsdesign/redesigning-the-browser-window/)  

Henrik Eneroth shows his ideas of how the browser UI could look, now that we all have widescreens. It’s beautiful.

I personally love how the “Tab Groups” work, and think Firefox could at least follow suit with regards to remembering my groups, dangit! With Firefox, I only ever set up some groups if I know I will be leaving Firefox open for a week or so. Otherwise, whatever.
