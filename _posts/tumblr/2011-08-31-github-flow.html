<a href="http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html">Github Flow</a><br/><p>We use the <a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">git flow model</a> on <a href="https://builder.addons.mozilla.org">FlightDeck</a>, and while it works quite well for our structured releases, I do love the methodology shared by the Github team. I&rsquo;d like to use Pull Requests a bit more, at the least. Having master <em>always</em> be stable sounds nice as well.</p>
