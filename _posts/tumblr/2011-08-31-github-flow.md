[Github Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html)  

We use the [git flow model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) on [FlightDeck](https://builder.addons.mozilla.org), and while it works quite well for our structured releases, I do love the methodology shared by the Github team. Iâ€™d like to use Pull Requests a bit more, at the least. Having master _always_ be stable sounds nice as well.
