<a href="http://devblog.bu.mp/who-said-android-apps-cant-look-good">Who said Android apps can’t look good?</a><br/><p>It kills me that companies who bothered to make a decent iOS app can&rsquo;t be bothered to make their Android app look good as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s a common misunderstanding that Android apps are harder to program than iOS.</p>
  
  <p>The real reason Android Apps historically haven’t looked good is because people haven’t put in the same care in building those apps.</p>
