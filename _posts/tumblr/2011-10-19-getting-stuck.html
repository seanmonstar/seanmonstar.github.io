<a href="http://www.jeffwofford.com/?p=835">Getting Stuck</a><br/><p>So very true:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A programmer’s greatest enemy isn’t the tools or the boss or the artists or the design or the legacy code or the third party code or the API or the OS. A programmer’s greatest enemy is getting stuck.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love my job, but being stuck is excruciatingly depressing. Besides not feeling productive, you worry that your workmates will call you out for sucking.</p>
