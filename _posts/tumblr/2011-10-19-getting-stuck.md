[Getting Stuck](http://www.jeffwofford.com/?p=835)  

So very true:

> A programmer’s greatest enemy isn’t the tools or the boss or the artists or the design or the legacy code or the third party code or the API or the OS. A programmer’s greatest enemy is getting stuck.

I love my job, but being stuck is excruciatingly depressing. Besides not feeling productive, you worry that your workmates will call you out for sucking.
