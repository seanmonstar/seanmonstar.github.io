<a href="http://theunderstatement.com/post/11982112928/android-orphans-visualizing-a-sad-history-of-support">Android Orphans</a><br/><p>Michael Degusta, on a truly sad fact about Android:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In other words, Appleâ€™s way of getting you to buy a new phone is to make you really happy with your current one, whereas apparently Android phone makers think they can get you to buy a new phone by making you really unhappy with your current one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s not Android&rsquo;s fault, but it still affects 99% of all Android consumers, and it&rsquo;s killing Android&rsquo;s image.</p>
