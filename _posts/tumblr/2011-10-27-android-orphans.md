[Android Orphans](http://theunderstatement.com/post/11982112928/android-orphans-visualizing-a-sad-history-of-support)  

Michael Degusta, on a truly sad fact about Android:

> In other words, Apple’s way of getting you to buy a new phone is to make you really happy with your current one, whereas apparently Android phone makers think they can get you to buy a new phone by making you really unhappy with your current one.

It’s not Android’s fault, but it still affects 99% of all Android consumers, and it’s killing Android’s image.
