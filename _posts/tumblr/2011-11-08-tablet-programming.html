<a href="http://yieldthought.com/post/12239282034/swapped-my-macbook-for-an-ipad">Programming on an iPad</a><br/><p>This is truly fascinating. With the use of <a href="http://vim.org">vim</a>, <a href="http://gnu.org/s/screen/">screen</a>, and <a href="http://linode.com">a Linode server</a>, Mark O'Conner was able to switch entirely to using an iPad for work.</p>

<p>With a Galaxy Tab 10.1 and my own virtual server, I&rsquo;m tempted to snag a keyboard and try this myself.</p>
