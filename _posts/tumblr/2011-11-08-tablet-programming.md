[Programming on an iPad](http://yieldthought.com/post/12239282034/swapped-my-macbook-for-an-ipad)  

This is truly fascinating. With the use of [vim](http://vim.org), [screen](http://gnu.org/s/screen/), and [a Linode server](http://linode.com), Mark O'Conner was able to switch entirely to using an iPad for work.

With a Galaxy Tab 10.1 and my own virtual server, I’m tempted to snag a keyboard and try this myself.
