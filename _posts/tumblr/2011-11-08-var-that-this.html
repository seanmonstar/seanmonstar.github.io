<p>I used to think say you should use <code>that</code> in the question &ldquo;What variable should I name <code>this</code> for closures?&rdquo; This was because <code>self</code> is already a variable that points to <code>window</code>. However, I&rsquo;ve since <a href="https://plus.google.com/117864091849261637847/posts/eB94v35EtEy">revised my opinion</a> on what is a good variable name in this case.</p>

<p>I now find <code>that</code> and <code>self</code> to be too vague.</p>

<p>Instead, I think the variable should be named after the Class that you are currently coding in. As always, it&rsquo;s easier to explain with code:</p>

<pre><code>var PackageController = new Class({

    doSomething: function() {
        var controller = this;

        someEl.addEvent('click', function(e) {
            controller.react();
        });
    }

});
</code></pre>

<p>The reason is because once you start delving a couple nested functions deep<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I find myself sometimes wondering if I bound <code>that</code> to the value I wanted. This way leaves little to wonder about. And since you read code far more than you write it, best to write the most readable code you can.</p>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>I know, some of that can be solved by moving the functions to named methods on other objects, but you&rsquo;d be lying if you said you never happened to have a function for a <code>.forEach</code> loop, and then another inside for an <code>.addEvent</code>, or something similar. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>

</ol>
</div>
