<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/17/2568348/galaxy-nexus-review">Galaxy Nexus on The Verge</a><br/><p>Joshua Topolsky about Ice Cream Sandwich:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to note that moving around all of these screens is buttery smooth. There&rsquo;s no lag, no stutter. Animations are fluid, and everything feels cohesive and solid. It&rsquo;s like Ice Cream Sandwich is more &ldquo;there&rdquo; than previous versions of Android.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m very excited for this new version. However, as neat as the Galaxy Nexus seems, why does it have to be almost 5-inches? I want something to fit in my pocket, not a sad attempt of tablet.</p>
