[Galaxy Nexus on The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2011/11/17/2568348/galaxy-nexus-review)  

Joshua Topolsky about Ice Cream Sandwich:

> I want to note that moving around all of these screens is buttery smooth. There’s no lag, no stutter. Animations are fluid, and everything feels cohesive and solid. It’s like Ice Cream Sandwich is more “there” than previous versions of Android.

I’m very excited for this new version. However, as neat as the Galaxy Nexus seems, why does it have to be almost 5-inches? I want something to fit in my pocket, not a sad attempt of tablet.
