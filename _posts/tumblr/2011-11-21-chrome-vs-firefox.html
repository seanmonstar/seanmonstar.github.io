<a href="http://adblockplus.org/blog/google-chrome-and-pre-installed-web-apps">The difference between Chrome and Firefox</a><br/><p>When people ask me why they should use Chrome or Firefox, I tell them that feature-wise they&rsquo;re pretty competitive. This sums up the difference greatly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a Google product and it has to benefit Google. It isn’t merely about making the web better, it is also about promoting Google products and giving them an advantage over competing services. [&hellip;] Even if it requires violating your privacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firefox wants the web to be better, and Chrome wants Google to be better.</p>
