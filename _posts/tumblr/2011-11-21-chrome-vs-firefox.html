<a href="http://adblockplus.org/blog/google-chrome-and-pre-installed-web-apps">The difference between Chrome and Firefox</a><br/><p>When people ask me why they should use Chrome or Firefox, I tell them that feature-wise they&rsquo;re pretty competitive. This sums up the difference greatly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a Google product and it has to benefit Google. It isnâ€™t merely about making the web better, it is also about promoting Google products and giving them an advantage over competing services. [&hellip;] Even if it requires violating your privacy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firefox wants the web to be better, and Chrome wants Google to be better.</p>
