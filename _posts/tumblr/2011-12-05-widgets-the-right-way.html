<a href="http://24ways.org/2011/defending-the-perimeter-against-web-widgets">Widgets the Right Way</a><br/><p>A lot of sites are using widgets more, be it for ads, or these terrible social buttons that have emerged. Besides not wanting to spend time downloading the social buttons that I won&rsquo;t use, what I hate the most is that they all have this in common: If they lag, they stall the rest of the page.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because they <code>document.write</code> their contents into the page, which prevents all further rendering until they&rsquo;ve loaded. Don&rsquo;t do that. Read this from Rich Thornett about how to make your widgets suck less.</p>
