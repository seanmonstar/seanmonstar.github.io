<a href="http://www.ghostery.com/">Ghostery</a><br/><p>I was slowly working on an <a href="https://builder.addons.mozilla.org/addon/1016653/latest/">add-on to block social buttons</a> on websites, but I recently just found <a href="http://www.ghostery.com/">Ghostery</a>. They have an extension for Chrome and Firefox, and it rocks.</p>
