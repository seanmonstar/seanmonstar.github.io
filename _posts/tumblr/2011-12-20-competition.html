<a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/19/flip-side">Or: Competition is Good</a><br/><p>John Gruber on the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/19/flip-side">threat of Google</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A different perspective would be that Google is the bigger threat, and that using Apple products is a way to better protect our privacy and personal information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was in response to Dave Winer suggesting <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/12/12/whyIUseAndroid.html#p11385">why he uses Android</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If there is no alternative to iOS then Apple will have exclusive control over what makes it to market. That is a future none of us should want to live in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree that both threats are very real. Which is why I hope neither wins, but that they continue to compete, forcing each other to be less evil.</p>
