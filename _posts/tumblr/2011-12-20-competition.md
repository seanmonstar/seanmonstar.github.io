[Or: Competition is Good](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/19/flip-side)  

John Gruber on the [threat of Google](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/19/flip-side):

> A different perspective would be that Google is the bigger threat, and that using Apple products is a way to better protect our privacy and personal information.

This was in response to Dave Winer suggesting [why he uses Android](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/12/12/whyIUseAndroid.html#p11385):

> If there is no alternative to iOS then Apple will have exclusive control over what makes it to market. That is a future none of us should want to live in.

I agree that both threats are very real. Which is why I hope neither wins, but that they continue to compete, forcing each other to be less evil.
