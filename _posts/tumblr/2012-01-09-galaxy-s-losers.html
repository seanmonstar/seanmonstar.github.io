<blockquote>
  <p>A full update to Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich for the GALAXY Tab(7-inch) and GALAXY S is not practicable due to hardware limitations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, as the Nexus S (which is the same internal hardware) is running Android 4 right now.</p>

<p>If an OEM were to release less phones a year, but provide excellent support for them for more than a year<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I could strongly recommend to my friends to only buy from them. But I can&rsquo;t recommend Samsung, since they don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I can only recommend <a href="http://google.com/nexus">Google&rsquo;s Nexus</a> brand, now.</p>

<p>Heck, most OEMs hardly support their devices for more than a month. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
