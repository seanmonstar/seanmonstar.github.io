<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-will-not-upgrade-galaxy-s-phones-2012-1">Samsung Will Not Upgrade Galaxy S Phones</a><br/><p>Samsung, regarding upgrading the Galaxy S software to Android 4:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A full update to Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich for the GALAXY Tab(7-inch) and GALAXY S is not practicable due to hardware limitations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, as the Nexus S (which is the same internal hardware) is running Android 4 right now.</p>

<p>If an OEM were to release less phones a year, but provide excellent support for them for more than a year<sup id="fnref:p15584706088-1"><a href="#fn:p15584706088-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, I could strongly recommend to my friends to only buy from them. But I can&rsquo;t recommend Samsung, since they don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I can only recommend <a href="http://google.com/nexus">Google&rsquo;s Nexus</a> brand, now.</p>

<p>Heck, most OEMs hardly support their devices for more than a month. <a href="#fnref:p15584706088-1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
