<a href="http://parislemon.com/post/15627530949/antitrust">Antitrust+?</a><br/><p><a href="http://parislemon.com/post/15627530949/antitrust">MG Siegler</a>, regarding <a href="http://searchengineland.com/googles-results-get-more-personal-with-search-plus-your-world-107285">Google&rsquo;s comments</a> that other social networks haven&rsquo;t shared their data for indexing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those other companies can argue that itâ€™s not in their best business interest to open that data. In effect, Google would be forcing them to hurt their business if they were to open the data up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, essentially, the &ldquo;other companies&rdquo;, such as Twitter and Facebook, will claim it&rsquo;s not fair that Google can show data from Google+ and not Facebook, when Facebook doesn&rsquo;t <em>want</em> to share its own data?</p>
