[Antitrust+?](http://parislemon.com/post/15627530949/antitrust)  

[MG Siegler](http://parislemon.com/post/15627530949/antitrust), regarding [Google’s comments](http://searchengineland.com/googles-results-get-more-personal-with-search-plus-your-world-107285) that other social networks haven’t shared their data for indexing:

> Those other companies can argue that it’s not in their best business interest to open that data. In effect, Google would be forcing them to hurt their business if they were to open the data up.

So, essentially, the “other companies”, such as Twitter and Facebook, will claim it’s not fair that Google can show data from Google+ and not Facebook, when Facebook doesn’t _want_ to share its own data?
