<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/01/search-plus-your-world.html">Personalizing Search</a><br/><p>Personally, this really excites me. Google has always been useful for un-biased information, but when you wanted to know if a movie was good, or where to eat, you got a bunch of strangers opinions. We all know a friend&rsquo;s opinion trumps 1,000 strangers.</p>

<p>I hope it will eventually be like this: I want some some good Mexican. Oh look, John and Kevin both recommend La Cantina.<sup id="fnref:p15637589516-1"><a href="#fn:p15637589516-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<div class="footnotes">

<p>The algorithm could analyze places that I already like, find my friends that also like those places, and see where else they enjoyed in the same category. <a href="#fnref:p15637589516-1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
