Google has always been useful for un-biased information, but when you wanted to know if a movie was good, or where to eat, you got a bunch of strangers opinions. We all know a friend&rsquo;s opinion trumps 1,000 strangers.</p>

<p>I hope it will eventually be like this: I want some some good Mexican. Oh look, John and Kevin both recommend La Cantina.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">

<ol>

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>The algorithm could analyze places that I already like, find my friends that also like those places, and see where else they enjoyed in the same category. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
