[AMD is Not the Answer](http://tomdale.net/2012/01/amd-is-not-the-answer/)  

Tom Dale, reiterating why [AMD is the wrong solution](http://tomdale.net/2012/01/amd-is-not-the-answer/) for JavaScript applications:

> In my opinion, having to write this out for every file sucks.

And:

> If build tools are required anyway, a much simpler solution should fit most developers’ needs.
