I&rsquo;d still say that MVC is the best solution we have seen so far. Python has great support for long-running async tasks, talking to various databases, and the like.</p>

<p>That said, I love my JavaScript. Here&rsquo;s where I see nodejs being a win: writing JavaScript on both sides of the stack feels great, and it gains small amounts of CPU time by making file I/O asynchronous. For other long-lasting tasks, such as resizing an image, you still need to set up a task in a queue for other CPUs to crunch.</p>
