<blockquote>
  <p>The recent redesign of the Twitter web pages and its official Twitter apps that shuffled Direct Messages off to a corner is essentially a side effect of this basic attitude: Twitter isn&rsquo;t a messaging company, it&rsquo;s a broadcasting (social) network.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thing is, I&rsquo;ve only ever seen it as a broadcasting network. To me, it&rsquo;s an extension of my blog. I can write things on Twitter that are short, and perhaps less important, because the barrier and expectation is lower. I never expect to have deep conversations over Twitter.</p>

<p>As much as Twitter hated the term earlier, they are starting to accept that it is a micro-blogging platform.</p>
