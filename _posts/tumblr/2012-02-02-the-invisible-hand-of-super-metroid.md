[The Invisible Hand of Super Metroid](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/HugoBille/20120114/9236/The_Invisible_Hand_of_Super_Metroid.php)  

Hugo Bille’s analysis of how Super Metroid guides a player while the player feels they are discovering things in the chaos on their own:

> Watching him, a complete newcomer to the genre, still find his way around Zebes in pretty much the same way I’d do, almost never once getting lost or stuck for any considerable amount of time, made me question how that could be.
