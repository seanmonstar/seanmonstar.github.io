<a href="http://chrome.blogspot.com/2012/02/introducing-chrome-for-android.html">Chrome for Android</a><br/><p>Exciting news for Android. It&rsquo;s always been a wonder why the stock Browser wasn&rsquo;t Chrome, and now it is. And it really rocks. The tab interface is fun to use.</p>

<p>However, since it uses an updated version of the webkit rendering engine, it should need to load that library upon initialization. The standard engine is always in memory, something that&rsquo;s held back Firefox for Android. Yet, Chrome doesn&rsquo;t seem to suffer from this.</p>

<p>Perhaps the mobile Firefox engineers already know, but I can think of 3 possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s a way to keep the new libraries in memory.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a way to replace the default engine</li>
<li>Or they just handle the loading in a better way.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whichever it is, hopefully mobile Firefox can find a way to improve their loading to be close to equivalent to Chrome&rsquo;s loading.</p>
