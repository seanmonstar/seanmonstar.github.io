[Users Are Not Worried about iOS Restrictions](http://zerodistraction.com/blog/2012/2/7/users-are-not-worried-about-ios-restrictions.html)  

Alex Knight:

> Apple simply can’t make enough of them as we speak to even fulfill demand. So how is it that anyone can believe more users are going to care about the platform’s restrictions?

It seems true that most people don’t care that much about the restrictions. I’d say its similar to how many people don’t care about the privacy issues with our browsing the internet. Go ask a random person is Starbucks if they’re concerned that Google records their searches, or has their email. Many will say they’ve never thought about it, and shrug and continue to use Google.

What is important, though, is that there are people who _do_ care, and fight, for all of us.
