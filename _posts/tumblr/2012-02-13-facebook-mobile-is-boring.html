<a href="http://www.splatf.com/2012/02/facebook-mobile/">Facebook Mobile is Boring</a><br/><p>Dan Frommer points out <a href="http://www.splatf.com/2012/02/facebook-mobile/">the issue with Facebook Mobile</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The more immediate problem, I’d say, is that Facebook’s mobile product is rather boring today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many claim that it&rsquo;s terrible because it&rsquo;s a WebView. That&rsquo;s non-sense. Twitter is native, and just as boring, UX-wise. People could do some really fun, interactive stuff with JavaScript and transitions. Why don&rsquo;t they?</p>
