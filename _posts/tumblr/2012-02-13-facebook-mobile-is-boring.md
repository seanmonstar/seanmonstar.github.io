[Facebook Mobile is Boring](http://www.splatf.com/2012/02/facebook-mobile/)  

Dan Frommer points out [the issue with Facebook Mobile](http://www.splatf.com/2012/02/facebook-mobile/):

> The more immediate problem, I’d say, is that Facebook’s mobile product is rather boring today.

Many claim that it’s terrible because it’s a WebView. That’s non-sense. Twitter is native, and just as boring, UX-wise. People could do some really fun, interactive stuff with JavaScript and transitions. Why don’t they?
