<a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2012/02/ipad-pc/">What Are PCs?</a><br/><p>As <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2012/02/ipad-pc/">Shawn Blanc puts it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When they say the iPad is not a PC what they mean is: <em>thereâ€™s no way I would or could give up my PC and use an iPad instead.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some people seem to think that tablets are not PCs. They aren&rsquo;t desktop computers, that&rsquo;s true. But these new devices, tablets and especially smartphones, are more personal than my desktop is. My phone is <strong>the</strong> most personal computer I&rsquo;ve owned to date.</p>
