[What Are PCs?](http://shawnblanc.net/2012/02/ipad-pc/)  

As [Shawn Blanc puts it](http://shawnblanc.net/2012/02/ipad-pc/):

> When they say the iPad is not a PC what they mean is: _there’s no way I would or could give up my PC and use an iPad instead._

Some people seem to think that tablets are not PCs. They aren’t desktop computers, that’s true. But these new devices, tablets and especially smartphones, are more personal than my desktop is. My phone is **the** most personal computer I’ve owned to date.
