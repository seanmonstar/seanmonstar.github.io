<a href="http://seanmonstar.com/2012/02/07/chrome-for-android.html">Chrome for Android: Update</a><br/><p>I upgraded my <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/2010/09/29/samsung-galaxy-vibrant-review.html">Galaxy S</a> to an Ice Cream Sandwich ROM just to try out Chrome for Android. I had also made some statements about how it must be better than Firefox for Android, before knowing better.</p>

<p>Now, having used it for the past 3 weeks, Chrome for Android is terrible. It&rsquo;s startup time is unbearable, often taking 15-30 seconds. Even simply the &ldquo;New Tab&rdquo; page takes way too long to load. Rendering pages is incredibly slow, and often the &ldquo;App Not Responding&rdquo; message shows up. It&rsquo;s even crashed my phone.</p>

<p>The up side, though, is that <a href="http://nightly.mozilla.org">Firefox for Android</a> saw some speed improvements with my switch to ICS. It now loads fairly quickly, opening to a new page in ~5 seconds.</p>

<p>The tab card-like interaction on Chrome for Android is still far more fun, though (if you can wait for it to load).</p>
