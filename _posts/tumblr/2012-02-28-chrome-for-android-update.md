[Chrome for Android: Update](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/2012-02-07-chrome-for-android/)  

I upgraded my [Galaxy S](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/2010-09-29-samsung-galaxy-vibrant-review/) to an Ice Cream Sandwich ROM just to try out Chrome for Android. I had also made some statements about how it must be better than Firefox for Android, before knowing better.

Now, having used it for the past 3 weeks, Chrome for Android is terrible. It’s startup time is unbearable, often taking 15-30 seconds. Even simply the “New Tab” page takes way too long to load. Rendering pages is incredibly slow, and often the “App Not Responding” message shows up. It’s even crashed my phone.

The up side, though, is that [Firefox for Android](http://nightly.mozilla.org) saw some speed improvements with my switch to ICS. It now loads fairly quickly, opening to a new page in ~5 seconds.

The tab card-like interaction on Chrome for Android is still far more fun, though (if you can wait for it to load).
