<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/b2g/">Boot to Gecko</a><br/><p>This is Mozilla&rsquo;s way of making the web be a capable platform for the mobile world. Instead of having to write Objective-C, or Java, and then, only being able to distribute through certain walled gardens, Boot to Gecko makes websites first-class citizens.</p>

<p>This means developers only need to make a website, using technology they already know, and their app is freely available (or they can charge, of course) to anyone who&rsquo;s mobile device implements the modern web.</p>

<p>Specifically, Boot to Gecko has every single part written in HTML and JavaScript, including the home screen, the dialer, the SMS app, all of it. <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/27/2827659/mozillas-boot-to-gecko-project-the-internet-is-your-phone-hands-on">The Verge has a write up and video</a> showing excellent performance, which is great news.</p>

<p>This is <strong>big</strong>.</p>
