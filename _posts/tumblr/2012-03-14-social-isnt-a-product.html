<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jw_on_tech/archive/2012/03/13/why-i-left-google.aspx">Social isn't a Product</a><br/><p>James Whittaker, an ex-Googler:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I couldn’t even get my own teenage daughter to look at Google+ twice, “social isn’t a product,” she told me after I gave her a demo, “social is people and the people are on Facebook.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s frustrating that Google+ is actually a better product; the web app has a better design, Hangouts are a cool addition, and the mobile app is far faster and less buggy than Facebook&rsquo;s turd. Still, being a better product isn&rsquo;t enough. Facebook wins, not by being the best, but by simply having everyone already on it.</p>

<p>Competition could exist if social networks could <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/2023/2012-01-23-cross-device-jabbering/">communicate between each other</a>, because then it would be all about who could make the <em>experience</em> better. Yet, as much as everyone knows competition is a good thing, no one ever wants competition against their own product.</p>
