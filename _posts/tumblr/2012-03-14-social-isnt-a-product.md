[Social isn't a Product](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jw_on_tech/archive/2012/03/13/why-i-left-google.aspx)  

James Whittaker, an ex-Googler:

> I couldn’t even get my own teenage daughter to look at Google+ twice, “social isn’t a product,” she told me after I gave her a demo, “social is people and the people are on Facebook.”

It’s frustrating that Google+ is actually a better product; the web app has a better design, Hangouts are a cool addition, and the mobile app is far faster and less buggy than Facebook’s turd. Still, being a better product isn’t enough. Facebook wins, not by being the best, but by simply having everyone already on it.

Competition could exist if social networks could [communicate between each other](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/cross-device-jabbering/), because then it would be all about who could make the _experience_ better. Yet, as much as everyone knows competition is a good thing, no one ever wants competition against their own product.
