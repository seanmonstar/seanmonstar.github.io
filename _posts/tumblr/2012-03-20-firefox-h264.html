<a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/03/video-mobile-and-the-open-web/">Firefox and H.264</a><br/><p>Brendan Eich of Mozilla:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What I do know for certain is this: H.264 is absolutely required right now to compete on mobile. I do not believe that we can reject H.264 content in Firefox on Android or in B2G and survive the shift to mobile.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say I care too much about the non-openness of H.264, but I&rsquo;m glad Mozilla does. The only thing allowing movie producers to use H.264 encoding is a &ldquo;promise&rdquo; that the owner of the technology won&rsquo;t charge them. If it ever goes away, and all those people get charged for using H.264, I won&rsquo;t have to pay directly, but the Internet will suffer as producers scramble to do something about it. That means I will be affected anyways.</p>

<p>Still, everyone else thinks it&rsquo;s better to just move forward with H.264 because there&rsquo;s already hardware that supports it.<sup id="fnref:p19648189954-1"><a href="#fn:p19648189954-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Mozilla is the only one that has stood against it, and now, all Firefox users get video through Flash, instead of the native HTML5 <code>video</code> element like the rest of the Internet.</p>

<p>The goal is to allow H.264 to play, but to continue to fight for a better technology as well.</p>
