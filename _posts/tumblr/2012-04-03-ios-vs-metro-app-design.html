<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh868262.aspx">iOS vs Metro App Design </a><br/><p>Apple may have been first, and Android is largely just copying, but Microsoft&rsquo;s touch interfaces really look like touch done right. There is much more emphasis on natural gestures, and a reduction of buttons. You&rsquo;re not manipulating an app, you&rsquo;re manipulating actual data and photos.</p>

<p>My only concern is hiding the app bar until gestured. Android hid things behind the menu button, and most people never knew to look there; despite it being a prominent, permanent button at the bottom of every phone.</p>
