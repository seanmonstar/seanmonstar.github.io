[iOS vs Metro App Design](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh868262.aspx)  

Apple may have been first, and Android is largely just copying, but Microsoft’s touch interfaces really look like touch done right. There is much more emphasis on natural gestures, and a reduction of buttons. You’re not manipulating an app, you’re manipulating actual data and photos.

My only concern is hiding the app bar until gestured. Android hid things behind the menu button, and most people never knew to look there; despite it being a prominent, permanent button at the bottom of every phone.
