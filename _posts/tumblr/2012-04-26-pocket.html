<a href="http://getpocket.com">Pocket</a><br/><p>I missed this while I was on vacation, but <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/read-it-later-reborn-pocket-saves-everything-for-later/">Read It Later re-branded itself as
Pocket</a>. Overall, it&rsquo;s a beautiful update. It&rsquo;s another app to point to when people
say that you can&rsquo;t make pretty applications on Android.</p>

<p>I have minor concerns with them making it into a free app. I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll switch to 
ads, but I still imagine the worst until they actually <a href="http://blog.ideashower.com/post/21276590202/why-pocket-went-free">tell us their plan</a>.</p>
