[Pocket](http://getpocket.com)  

I missed this while I was on vacation, but [Read It Later re-branded itself as Pocket](http://www.macstories.net/news/read-it-later-reborn-pocket-saves-everything-for-later/). Overall, it’s a beautiful update. It’s another app to point to when people say that you can’t make pretty applications on Android.

I have minor concerns with them making it into a free app. I don’t think they’ll switch to ads, but I still imagine the worst until they actually [tell us their plan](http://blog.ideashower.com/post/21276590202/why-pocket-went-free).
