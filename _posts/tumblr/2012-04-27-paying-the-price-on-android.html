<a href="http://mykehurley.net/2012/04/paying-the-price-on-android/">Paying The Price On Android</a><br/><p>Myke Hurley has an interesting take at why people don&rsquo;t buy Android apps:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If apps are generally crappy looking or functioning, should users be more accustomed to paying little to nothing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There certainly are an abundance of crappy apps. That doesn&rsquo;t stop me from buying good apps.</p>

<p>Many people point to this <a href="http://www.papermill.me/firstweeks/">blog post about Papermill</a>, which is a nicely designed Android app for Instapaper. It says that since it didn&rsquo;t sell well, Android users don&rsquo;t want to pay for good apps. That&rsquo;s not why I didn&rsquo;t buy it. I didn&rsquo;t because it didn&rsquo;t strike me as a good app. It looks nicely <em>designed</em>, but it&rsquo;s lacking many features from Instapaper. Instead, I spent my money on ReadItLater, back when it was a paid app. It does more, and looked good to boot.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say the reason is a bit of a catch-22. Users don&rsquo;t buy apps on Android, because developers don&rsquo;t make good, featured apps. In turn, the apps aren&rsquo;t developed because users don&rsquo;t apps. Android users will spend their money on excellent apps.</p>
