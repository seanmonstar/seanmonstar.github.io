Angus Croll, on trying to improve EcmaScript 6:

> There are some in the JavaScript development community who have severe misgivings over this approach, while others are generally happy but have the knowledge and experience to offer improvements. Unfortunately members of both groups are having a hard time being heard.

There are tons of (conflicting) opinions out there on where JavaScript should go, and I hope this doesn’t give naysayers too high of a pedestal, but overall the idea seems sound. [JSFixed](https://github.com/JSFixed/JSFixed/issues) is trying to provide a familiar place for JavaScript developers to add their input on the proposed changes to their language.
