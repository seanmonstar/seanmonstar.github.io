<a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/05/03/lasting-value">Lasting Value</a><br/><p>This article by Marco Arment made me think about what things I&rsquo;ve created that would last. The software I write likely won&rsquo;t be used in 10 years, but I sure hope some of the articles I&rsquo;ve written could be. I looked through my archive, and found a small number of articles that meet that description. I thought it&rsquo;d be fun to share them again, here.</p>

</ul>

<p>There&rsquo;s a few more articles that I&rsquo;m <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/tagged/bestof">rather proud of</a>, but I&rsquo;m not as sure they would be useful to someone in the 2020&rsquo;s.</p>
