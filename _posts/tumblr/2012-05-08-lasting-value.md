[Lasting Value](http://www.marco.org/2012/05/03/lasting-value)  

This article by Marco Arment made me think about what things I’ve created that would last. The software I write likely won’t be used in 10 years, but I sure hope some of the articles I’ve written could be. I looked through my archive, and found a small number of articles that meet that description. I thought it’d be fun to share them again, here.

- [Good Things Come to Those Who Ask](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/2011-08-04-good-things-come-to-those-who-ask/)
- [Enthusiam Starts at the Top](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/2010-04-01-enthusiasm-starts-at-the-top/)
- [A Less-Random Generator](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/2010-03-03-a-less-random-generator/)
- [Tablets Will Replace Everything](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/2010-01-07-tablets-will-replace-everything/)

There’s a few more articles that I’m [rather proud of](http://seanmonstar.com/tagged/bestof), but I’m not as sure they would be useful to someone in the 2020’s.
