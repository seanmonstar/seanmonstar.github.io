[Ads Are Secondary](http://brooksreview.net/2012/05/greed-free-and-change/)  

As Ben Brooks points out, many mediums are free, and show ads instead. He suggests mediums (specifically, writing) should ditch ads and ask viewers to pay directly. My feeling on the matter is that the best option is a mixed one.

Mediums should provide their content, free of charge, but showing tasteful ads. Mediums should probably also offer a way for users to directly pay for the content they enjoy. If they pay, itâ€™s _imperative_ that the ads be removed. Paying and having to view ads is just dirty[^1].
