[Android vs iOS Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=NMiY1kSTHZw)  

I think both Android and iOS are decent operating systems, and that they serve different kinds of people. One thing that always irks me is when people say againt Android “iOS is just better put together.” This video shows a couple examples where Android is far more cohesive than iOS is.

I’m sure Apple fans would flock and come up with examples where Android is less consistent or nice. It seems obvious to me, then, that we just leave it as each appeals to different people, and shut up about it.
