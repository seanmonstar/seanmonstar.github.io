<a href="http://brooksreview.net/2012/05/icloud-power/">How is lock-in good for anyone besides the owner?</a><br/><p>Ben Brooks wrote this regarding what is gained by improving iCloud:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Platform lock-in. If all your data lives in iCloud and not Microsoft or Google, well you are far less likely to undertake such a large data migration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s certainly great for Apple, but no one else. Lock-in is the enemy of competition. It&rsquo;s why <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/2023/2012-03-14-social-isnt-a-product/">social networks don&rsquo;t <em>really</em> have to compete</a> over the best experience. And it&rsquo;s why so many people prefer keeping their notes in plain .txt files, because it&rsquo;s easily tranferable.</p>

<p>Lock-in is never good for users.</p>
