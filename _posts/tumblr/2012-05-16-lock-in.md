That’s certainly great for Apple, but no one else. Lock-in is the enemy of competition. It’s why [social networks don’t _really_ have to compete](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/2012-03-14-social-isnt-a-product/) over the best experience. And it’s why so many people prefer keeping their notes in plain .txt files, because it’s easily tranferable.

Lock-in is never good for users.
