<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtFjCGg1N68">Future of Xbox</a><br/><p>I&rsquo;ve had an Xbox for close to a decade now, just for the games. The fact that Microsoft just keeps improving it is icing. In fact, this video makes me feel like Microsoft is better equipped to revolutionize the living room than Google or Apple is.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t wait for SmartGlass.</p>
