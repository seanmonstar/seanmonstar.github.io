<p>I&rsquo;ve been working at Mozilla on the same project for a year and a half now, and it&rsquo;s time for some change.</p>

<p>I spent that time working on <a href="https://builder.addons.mozilla.org">Add-on Builder</a>, taking it from prototype to launched product. With it being largely a single-page app, I refined a lot of my views on organizing and structure large amounts of JavaScript. I formed that new knowledge into <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/tagged/shipyard">Shipyard</a>, and got to work on that and improve it much the first half of this year.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m proud of how easy it is to start writing a new add-on for Firefox, test it, and publish it to <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org">addons.mozilla.org</a>; all entirely in the browser.</p>

<p>I started thinking I wanted to do <em>more</em>, though. By more, I mean affect more people on the Internet. As various friends would ask me what I do at Mozilla, I would tell them I make a tool for developers to more easily make add-ons, that my friends might use. Except many don&rsquo;t use add-ons, or even Firefox. I realized I wanted to make something that normal people would use. What is something on the Internet that normal people use, and currently sucks? Logging in.</p>

<p><a href="http://identity.mozilla.com">Mozilla&rsquo;s Identity team</a> has been working on a new system to greatly improve signing into the Internet. I&rsquo;ve been watching it since they announced it, and now I get to help create and improve on the new <a href="https://persona.org">Persona</a> project.</p>

<p>If we do our job right, eventually when my friends ask me what I do, I can say: I helped make it so you no longer need to use passwords everywhere. I helped make your online identity more secure. I helped make <strong>signing into the Internet awesomer</strong>.</p>
