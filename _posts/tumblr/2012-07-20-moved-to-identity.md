I’ve been working at Mozilla on the same project for a year and a half now, and it’s time for some change.

I spent that time working on [Add-on Builder](https://builder.addons.mozilla.org), taking it from prototype to launched product. With it being largely a single-page app, I refined a lot of my views on organizing and structure large amounts of JavaScript. I formed that new knowledge into [Shipyard](http://seanmonstar.com/tagged/shipyard), and got to work on that and improve it much the first half of this year.

I’m proud of how easy it is to start writing a new add-on for Firefox, test it, and publish it to [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org); all entirely in the browser.

I started thinking I wanted to do _more_, though. By more, I mean affect more people on the Internet. As various friends would ask me what I do at Mozilla, I would tell them I make a tool for developers to more easily make add-ons, that my friends might use. Except many don’t use add-ons, or even Firefox. I realized I wanted to make something that normal people would use. What is something on the Internet that normal people use, and currently sucks? Logging in.

[Mozilla’s Identity team](http://identity.mozilla.com) has been working on a new system to greatly improve signing into the Internet. I’ve been watching it since they announced it, and now I get to help create and improve on the new [Persona](https://persona.org) project.

If we do our job right, eventually when my friends ask me what I do, I can say: I helped make it so you no longer need to use passwords everywhere. I helped make your online identity more secure. I helped make **signing into the Internet awesomer**.
