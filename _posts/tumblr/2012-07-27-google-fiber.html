<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/07/super-fast-fiber-for-kansas-city.html">Google Fiber</a><br/><p>Truly, this is whole buckets of good. Cox currently wants to charge me about the same price, for their &ldquo;premium&rdquo; 20Mbps. Google is saying that&rsquo;s non-sense; for $70, you should have speeds 50 times that. And Google is even able to <a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/07/26/the-economics-of-google-fiber-and-what-it-means-for-u-s-broadband/">turn a profit</a>, so the cable companies are definitely Doing It Wrong.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/28088266220/google-fiber-is-the-very-best-of-google">MG Siegler puts it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now please bring this everywhere in the U.S. and force the cable companies to get busy innovating or get busy dying.</p>
