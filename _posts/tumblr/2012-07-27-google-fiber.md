[Google Fiber](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/07/super-fast-fiber-for-kansas-city.html)  

Truly, this is whole buckets of good. Cox currently wants to charge me about the same price, for their “premium” 20Mbps. Google is saying that’s non-sense; for $70, you should have speeds 50 times that. And Google is even able to [turn a profit](http://gigaom.com/2012/07/26/the-economics-of-google-fiber-and-what-it-means-for-u-s-broadband/), so the cable companies are definitely Doing It Wrong.

As [MG Siegler puts it](http://parislemon.com/post/28088266220/google-fiber-is-the-very-best-of-google):

> Now please bring this everywhere in the U.S. and force the cable companies to get busy innovating or get busy dying.
