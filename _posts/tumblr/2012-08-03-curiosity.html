<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ki_Af_o9Q9s">Curiosity</a><br/><p>Physics is awesome. They can completely calculate everything about the Mars descent ahead of time, and tell a computer to do it all.</p>

<p>And they have to, because Mars is currently <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=7+light+minutes">7</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-second">light minutes</a> away from Earth. That&rsquo;d be like playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_TIE_Fighter">Tie Fighter</a> with a ping of 840000ms, or 14 minutes of latency.</p>
