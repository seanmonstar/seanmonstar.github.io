Physics is awesome. They can completely calculate everything about the Mars descent ahead of time, and tell a computer to do it all.

And they have to, because Mars is currently [7](https://www.google.com/search?q=7+light+minutes) [light minutes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-second) away from Earth. Thatâ€™d be like playing [Tie Fighter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_TIE_Fighter) with a ping of 840000ms, or 14 minutes of latency.
