<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007OZNZG0/?tag=seanmonstar-20">Kindle Paperwhite</a><br/><p>Of the things Amazon announced today, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007OZNZG0/?tag=seanmonstar-20">Kindle Paperwhite</a> interests me the most. I was curious to know what exactly was new in this one, and found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/mpd/permalink/m9OMW36M7OB0R/?tag=seanmonstar-20">video</a> they have on the product page to be worth watching.</p>

<p>Particularly, my wife has a Kindle, and she always comments how nice and light it is when she uses it, but she&rsquo;s often reading on a tablet more than the Kindle. She gives two reasons why, and the Paperwhite should alleviate them:</p>

<ol>
<li>She can&rsquo;t read her Kindle in the dark.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s clunky to download new books using the Kindle (pre Touch version).</li>
</ol>
