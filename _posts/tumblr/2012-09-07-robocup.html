<a href="http://thisistheverge.tumblr.com/post/31057180758/real-steel-the-broken-necks-and-baby-steps-of">RoboCup</a><br/><p>Paul Miller&rsquo;s coverage about <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/7/3287515/robocup-2012-robots-soccer-broken-necks-baby-steps">robots trying to playing soccer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The robots see the game as a &ldquo;state machine,&rdquo; a flow chart of best-case scenarios. A state machine asks &ldquo;what is my status?&rdquo; and then executes a routine based on that status.</p>
  
  <p>Do I see a ball?<br/>
  If yes, then go to it.<br/>
  Am I near a ball?<br/>
  If yes, then kick it at the opponent&rsquo;s goal.</p>
  
  <p>If the robot is confused about its status, all of its actions will be incorrect â€” and even the right status doesn&rsquo;t guarantee a useful action.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, real robots. Robots are <em>awesome</em>. These guys hope to have a team of robots that can beat professional human players by 2050. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s like he says: with state machines, it would be an unbelievable feat to get them working. It will likely require adaptive AI to succeed.</p>
