[RoboCup](http://thisistheverge.tumblr.com/post/31057180758/real-steel-the-broken-necks-and-baby-steps-of)  

Paul Miller’s coverage about [robots trying to playing soccer](http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/7/3287515/robocup-2012-robots-soccer-broken-necks-baby-steps):

> The robots see the game as a “state machine,” a flow chart of best-case scenarios. A state machine asks “what is my status?” and then executes a routine based on that status.
> 
> Do I see a ball?  
> If yes, then go to it.  
> Am I near a ball?  
> If yes, then kick it at the opponent’s goal.
> 
> If the robot is confused about its status, all of its actions will be incorrect — and even the right status doesn’t guarantee a useful action.

Yes, real robots. Robots are _awesome_. These guys hope to have a team of robots that can beat professional human players by 2050. Unfortunately, it’s like he says: with state machines, it would be an unbelievable feat to get them working. It will likely require adaptive AI to succeed.
