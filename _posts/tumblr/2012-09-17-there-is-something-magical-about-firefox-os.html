<blockquote>
  <p>Let me be perfectly clear; Firefox OS is the start of something huge. It&rsquo;s a revolution in waiting. A breath of fresh air. A culmination of bleeding-edge technology. It&rsquo;s magical and it&rsquo;s going to change everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He goes on to discuss 2 big reasons why Firefox OS must happen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The second reason for &lsquo;Why Firefox OS?&rsquo; is that it&rsquo;s an attempt to not only provide an open alternative mobile platform, but to stand up to and try and influence the big proprietary mobile players to change things.</p>
