[Rob Hawkes about the upcoming Firefox OS](http://rawkes.com/articles/there-is-something-magical-about-firefox-os):

> Let me be perfectly clear; Firefox OS is the start of something huge. It’s a revolution in waiting. A breath of fresh air. A culmination of bleeding-edge technology. It’s magical and it’s going to change everything.

He goes on to discuss 2 big reasons why Firefox OS must happen:

> The second reason for ‘Why Firefox OS?’ is that it’s an attempt to not only provide an open alternative mobile platform, but to stand up to and try and influence the big proprietary mobile players to change things.
