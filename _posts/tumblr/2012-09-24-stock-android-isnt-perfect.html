<a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2012/09/18/ux-things-i-hate-about-android/">Stock Android Isn't Perfect</a><br/><p>Ron Amadeo over at <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2012/09/18/ux-things-i-hate-about-android/">Android Police analyzes how inconsistent Android is</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stock Android isn&rsquo;t perfect either, and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re here to talk about today. Jelly Bean has all sorts of confusing user interfaces, weird bugs, things that don&rsquo;t make any sense, and things that desperately need polishing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve enjoyed Android, but I wholeheartedly agree. The one that catches me all the time: not being able to copy text from GTalk, which I use every day. It&rsquo;s frustrating, to say the least.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s enough so that I&rsquo;m eying a Windows Phone 8 device this Fall. Hopefully it&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;grass is greener&rdquo; situation.</p>
