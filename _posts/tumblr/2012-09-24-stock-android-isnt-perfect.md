[Stock Android Isn't Perfect](http://www.androidpolice.com/2012/09/18/ux-things-i-hate-about-android/)  

Ron Amadeo over at [Android Police analyzes how inconsistent Android is](http://www.androidpolice.com/2012/09/18/ux-things-i-hate-about-android/):

> Stock Android isn’t perfect either, and that’s what we’re here to talk about today. Jelly Bean has all sorts of confusing user interfaces, weird bugs, things that don’t make any sense, and things that desperately need polishing.

I’ve enjoyed Android, but I wholeheartedly agree. The one that catches me all the time: not being able to copy text from GTalk, which I use every day. It’s frustrating, to say the least.

It’s enough so that I’m eying a Windows Phone 8 device this Fall. Hopefully it’s not a “grass is greener” situation.
