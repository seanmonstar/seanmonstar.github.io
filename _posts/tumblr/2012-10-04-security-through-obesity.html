<a href="http://www.opine.me/a-better-way-to-store-password-hashes/">Security through Obesity</a><br/><p>A really interesting way to store passwords. Short version: store the hashes in a table, with no foreign key what-so-ever, such that:</p>

<ol><li>The owner of a given password is no longer explicitly discernible.</li>
<li>You can fill the <code>hashes</code> table with tons of false hashes, making it difficult to know which hashes to brute force.</li>
</ol>
