<p>With the recent actions of Twitter, there&rsquo;s a lot of interest in finding the right answer to our social status. We realize that there is a great deal of importance to our shorter status messages, and don&rsquo;t want them &ldquo;owned&rdquo; by a company that is more interested in its own well-being<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> than our ability to share them. It&rsquo;s part of our identity. It&rsquo;s becoming increasingly fundamental, such that we&rsquo;ve started to look elsewhere.</p>

<p><a href="http://seanmonstar.com/2023/2012-08-09-app-net/">App.net isn&rsquo;t the solution</a>. Besides the points I made  previously, App.net is in the same group as Twitter: it owns our status messages inside a vault, and we simply <a href="https://lorenb.tent.is/posts/b08bts">hope that it will be more trustworthy than Twitter was</a>. That can&rsquo;t be the right way.</p>

<p>As I said previously, we need a de-centralized open standard, like e-mail or RSS.</p>

<h3>Enter Tent.io</h3>

<p><a href="http://tent.io">Tent.io</a> is a realization of that promise. I can run my own Tent server, and host and publish my own status messages on <em>my own</em> property. You can do the same. And our friends who aren&rsquo;t as technically-savvy can use a hosted provider that&rsquo;s perhaps offset by ads. We can all subscribe to each other, and see each others statuses, just like we currently can on Twitter.</p>

<p>The first client to consume this new Tent protocol is <a href="http://seanmonstar.tent.is">Tent.is</a>. <a href="https://github.com/tent/tent.io/wiki/Explaining-Tent">They describe the both of these</a> like so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tent.io is a protocol like email, and Tent.is is a service like gmail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyone can setup an account at <a href="http://tent.is">tent.is</a> right now. I could then setup a Tent server at tent.seanmonstar.com or something, and we could still follow each other seemlessly. This is huge. This is The Way forward.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example with systems we already have: My friends can set up a blog on wordpress.com or tumblr, and I can subscribe to their RSS feed in Google Reader. In turn, I can host a blog myself, and my friends can subscribe to my RSS feed in whichever reader they&rsquo;d prefer. This is what Tent.io is, but with less friction, a little more structure, and some privacy controls. It&rsquo;s clearly much more than a <a href="http://afreshcup.com/home/2012/10/3/thinking-about-tent.html">simple Twitter clone</a>.</p>

<p>You can continue to use App.net all you like<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, but please realize that Tent.io is the real solution, one where a single company no longer owns our status and identity.</p>

<p>To be fair, most companies must put their own well-being above everyone else, in order to survive. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
</li>

<li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote">
<p>It would be interesting if App.net were to switch their back-end and become a premium client for Tent.io. Pay to use it, because it&rsquo;s a better client, or something. But then, it&rsquo;s part of the solution. It&rsquo;s helping make this de-centralized. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
