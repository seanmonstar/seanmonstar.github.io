<a href="http://www.polygon.com/2012/10/30/3577710/disney-purchases-lucasfilm-in-4-billion-acquisition-deal-includes">Disney better leave 1313 alone.</a><br/><p>The guys at LucasArts think 1313 will be just fine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the time being all projects are business as usual. We are excited about all the possibilities that Disney brings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But then Disney CEO has to go and say stupid scary things:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We&rsquo;re likely to focus more on social and mobile than we are on console.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All I can say is that if they cancel 1313, I&rsquo;ll lead the OccupyDisneyland movement myself.</p>
