[Disney better leave 1313 alone.](http://www.polygon.com/2012/10/30/3577710/disney-purchases-lucasfilm-in-4-billion-acquisition-deal-includes)  

The guys at LucasArts think 1313 will be just fine:

> For the time being all projects are business as usual. We are excited about all the possibilities that Disney brings.

But then Disney CEO has to go and say stupid scary things:

> We’re likely to focus more on social and mobile than we are on console.

All I can say is that if they cancel 1313, I’ll lead the OccupyDisneyland movement myself.
