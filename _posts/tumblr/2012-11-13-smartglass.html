  <p>My only gripe is that while SmartGlass itself reacts the way you would expect, controlling your Xbox with your connected device does not.</p>

<p>As much as <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/2012/06/22/future-of-xbox.html">I hoped Microsoft would better integrate my living room</a>, it definitely seems like they fell a little short. At the same time, it suddenly gives me more use and features for free.<sup id="fnref:p35649774150-1"><a href="#fn:p35649774150-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I just hope they release some updates such that interacting with my Xbox becomes an absolute delight. I&rsquo;d buy the next one if they do.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;d be cool if they make <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/2012/11/12/machete-order.html">my Star Wars viewing</a> more enhanced, with additional info, or a map of where in the galaxy the scene is. <em>That</em> would be awesome. <a href="#fnref:p35649774150-1" rev="footnote">↩</a></p>
