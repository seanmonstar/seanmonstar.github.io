  <p>My only gripe is that while SmartGlass itself reacts the way you would expect, controlling your Xbox with your connected device does not.</p>

<p>As much as <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/2023/2012-06-22-future-of-xbox/">I hoped Microsoft would better integrate my living room</a>, it definitely seems like they fell a little short. At the same time, it suddenly gives me more use and features for free.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I just hope they release some updates such that interacting with my Xbox becomes an absolute delight. I&rsquo;d buy the next one if they do.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;d be cool if they make <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/2023/2012-11-12-machete-order/">my Star Wars viewing</a> more enhanced, with additional info, or a map of where in the galaxy the scene is. <em>That</em> would be awesome. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
