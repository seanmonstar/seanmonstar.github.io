As much as [I hoped Microsoft would better integrate my living room](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/future-of-xbox/), it definitely seems like they fell a little short. At the same time, it suddenly gives me more use and features for free.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I just hope they release some updates such that interacting with my Xbox becomes an absolute delight. I’d buy the next one if they do.

It’d be cool if they make [my Star Wars viewing](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/machete-order/) more enhanced, with additional info, or a map of where in the galaxy the scene is. _That_ would be awesome.&nbsp;[↩︎](#fnref:1)
