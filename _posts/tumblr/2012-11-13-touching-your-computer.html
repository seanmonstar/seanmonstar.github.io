<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/11/do-you-wanna-touch.html">Touching Your Computer </a><br/><p>A gushing review of the Surface by Jeff Atwood.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How wonderful it is to flip open the Surface and quickly type a 4 paragraph email response when I need to. How wonderful it is to browse the web and touch whatever I want to. And switching between the two modes of interaction – sometimes typing, sometimes touching – is completely natural.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read plenty, and played with one myself, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure I love the concept. I probably need a Surface Pro, and hopefully they have more of the kinks worked out. I was thinking of waiting for v2 before I read this, also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It&rsquo;s a fascinating glimpse into the future, but it&rsquo;ll be totally utterly obsolete in 2 years. Do not buy this device expecting longevity.</p>
