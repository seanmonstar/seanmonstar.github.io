<blockquote>
  <p>In reality, it’s exactly backwards: proficient users can deal with a crappy computer, but casual users need as good a computer as possible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see the point, and agree to an extent. At the same time, nerds like us care about what processor is going to have it&rsquo;s bits flipped over and over. Normal users don&rsquo;t need to care about that nonsense.</p>

<p>When someone starts to ask me how much RAM they need, or how many &ldquo;googlebytes&rdquo; the processor should be, I stop them right there. If the computer has 6GB or 8GB, they&rsquo;re not going to really care. If the computer comes with i5 or an i7, they&rsquo;re likely not going to care. I say that at this point, computers are fast enough what you want to do with it; now you need to make sure the actual interacting with it is enjoyable:</p>

<ul>
<li>Play with the touchpad, use some gestures.</li>
<li>Type a couple paragraphs with the keyboard, and see if you like the keys.</li>
<li>Pick it up, and see if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind carrying all the weight in your bag.</li>
<li>Look at the battery life, and see if it will stay alive longer than you plan to be away from a wall socket.</li>
</ul>
