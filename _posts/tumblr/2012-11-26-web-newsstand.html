<a href="http://www.usabilitypost.com/2012/11/26/the-gleam-of-a-better-publishing-model/">A Better Publishing Model</a><br/><p>Dmitry Fadeyev proposes an Web-based Newstand:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s needed is a marketplace much like Apple’s Newsstand, but for the Web.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Add that with Ryan Singer&rsquo;s comments about a <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3334-tablets-are-waiting-for-their-movable-type">Movable Type for iOS</a>, and I think we&rsquo;re thinking in the right direction.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the middle, that allows publications to write their articles in HTML, like they already know how, and get their &ldquo;issues&rdquo; delivered in the background and with subscriptions, on iOS, Android, and any other platform that becomes popular. And the content is still available on a website, for those people who want to use a traditional computer.</p>
