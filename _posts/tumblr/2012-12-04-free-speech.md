[Free Speech on the Internet](http://www.theverge.com/2012/12/4/3726440/tweets-of-rage-free-speech-on-the-internet)  

A fantastic read by Nilay Patel at The Verge:

> The confusion comes from those first five words: “Congress shall make no law.” Congress isn’t allowed to abridge your freedom of speech. That means the First Amendment only applies to the government, not private parties.
