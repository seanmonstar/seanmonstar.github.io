[tentmonstar for Android](http://seanmonstar.com/tentmonstar)  

I’ve been [pretty pumped about Tent](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/tent-io/), so much so that I’ve written an Android client[^1]. I actually put it in the Google Play Store 2 weeks ago, but [forgot to link to it](https://seanmonstar.tent.is/posts/y3fcjl).

Get it in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.monstarlab.tentmonstar), and let me know if there are [issues](https://github.com/seanmonstar/tentmonstar/issues).



[^1]: The client will do you no good without a Tent server. You can [set your own up](https://github.com/tent/tentd/), or register at [tent.is](https://tent.is).
