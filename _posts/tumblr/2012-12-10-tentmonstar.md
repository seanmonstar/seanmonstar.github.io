[tentmonstar for Android](http://seanmonstar.com/tentmonstar)  

I’ve been [pretty pumped about Tent](http://seanmonstar.com/2022/07/28/2012-10-04-tent-io.html), so much so that I’ve written an Android client<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I actually put it in the Google Play Store 2 weeks ago, but [forgot to link to it](https://seanmonstar.tent.is/posts/y3fcjl).

Get it in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.monstarlab.tentmonstar), and let me know if there are [issues](https://github.com/seanmonstar/tentmonstar/issues).

The client will do you no good without a Tent server. You can [set your own up](https://github.com/tent/tentd/), or register at [tent.is](https://tent.is).&nbsp;[↩︎](#fnref:1)
