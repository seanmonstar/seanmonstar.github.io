<a href="http://www.themorningnews.org/article/a-spot-for-tea">Starbucks + Teavana</a><br/><p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/11/14/news/starbucks-teavana/index.html">Starbucks buying Teavana</a> could do great things for tea:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If Starbucks is willing to do the heavy lifting, willing to suggest to a populace that Chinese teas are more than a complement to General Tsoâ€™s chicken, willing to point out the difference between an oolong and a pu-erh, I will be much obliged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This article reminded me of what <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/hey_wait_a_minute/2007/12/dont_fear_starbucks.single.html">Starbucks did previously to coffee</a>: made otherwise non-coffee drinkers aware of coffee, and then made some of them go find <em>good</em> coffee.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Local consumers might have a formative experience with a Java Chip Frappuccino, but chances are they&rsquo;ll branch out to the cheaper, less crowded, and often higher-quality independent cafe later on.</p>
</blockquote>
