<p>As you brew tea, you notice that different types demand different temperatures. I don&rsquo;t use a fancy kettle, simply a pot filled with water. I also don&rsquo;t have a thermometer, but I was sure there had to be a way to tell the temperature using my eyes. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling#Levels_of_boiling">Wikipedia</a> came to the rescue:</p>

<ul><li>shrimp eyes: about 70-80 °C (155–175 °F) – separate bubbles, rising to top</li>
<li>crab eyes: about 80 °C (175 °F) – streams of bubbles</li>
<li>fish eyes: about 80-90 °C (175–195 °F) – larger bubbles</li>
<li>rope of pearls: about 90-95 °C (195–205 °F) – steady streams of large bubbles</li>
<li>raging torrent: rolling boil, swirling and roiling </li>
</ul>
