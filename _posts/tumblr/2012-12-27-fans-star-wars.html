  <p>So I’m not worried. We’re about to enter into a era where the fans are going to be in control of Star Wars. And that’s really the most exciting part.</p>

<p>Exactly. KOTOR, The Force Unleashed, and Dark Forces were some awesome stories set in the Star Wars Universe, made my people who were fans first, producers second, of Star Wars.</p>
