title: there’s another way of using time that’s common among people who make things,
  like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in units of half
  a day at least. You can’t write or program well in units of an hour. That’s barely
  enough time to get started. When you’re operating on the maker’s schedule, meetings
  are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into
  two pieces each too small to do anything hard in.
