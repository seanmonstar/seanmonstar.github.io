["After Sandy Hook And Virginia Tech, I’m Done With Violent Video Games"](http://kotaku.com/5970039/after-sandy-hook-and-virginia-tech-im-done-with-violent-video-games)  

Another perspective on violent video games + the shooting. I enjoyed Jeremy Norman’s pull quote here:

> I don’t want to explain to my son why daddy is shooting the guys on the television. Why that’s okay, but when it happens in real life, people cry.
