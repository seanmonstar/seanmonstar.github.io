[Game journalism is its own worst enemy](http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/bad-linking-plagiarism-and-re-writes-how-game-journalism-is-its-own-worst-e)  

Game journalism is an oxymoron. There’s no point in reading more than one game news site, because they all say the same thing, literally:

> In mainstream news outlets it’s a scandal when someone is caught plagiarizing work, and the writers usually lose their jobs. In gaming news when someone is caught plagiarizing work it’s Tuesday.
