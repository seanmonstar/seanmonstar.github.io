<a href="http://starwars.com/news/star-wars-is-being-kick-started-with-dynamite-jj-abrams-to-direct-star-wars-episode-vii.html">J.J. Abrams to Direct Episode VII</a><br/><p>Mixed feelings come with this news: The Star Trek movie was fantastic. But my friend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CableSC/posts/313618095416979">Caleb says it best</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know how I feel about this&hellip; it&rsquo;s almost like sci-fi incest. We need the creative diversity and distinction between the two IPs. They are &lsquo;rivals&rsquo; after all.</p>
