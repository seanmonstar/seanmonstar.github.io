<a href="http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2013/02/13/">Opera Switches to WebKit</a><br/><p>This is not something to celebrate.</p>

<p>Sure, everyone thinks that since WebKit is currently rocking it, that everyone should just switch to it, and stop &ldquo;wasting&rdquo; time competing. The truth is, that&rsquo;s <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/11/microsoft-begs-web-devs-not-to-make-webkit-the-new-ie6/">what happened to IE6</a>. It was the new hotness when it came out, but without competition, it sizzled.</p>

<p>A more recent example: CSS gradients. If there were no competing browsers, the de-facto standard of gradients would be what the <a href="https://www.webkit.org/blog/175/introducing-css-gradients/">WebKit came up with</a>, instead of the saner version in the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-images/#linear-gradients">specification</a>.</p>
