[Google+ Sign-In](https://developers.google.com/+/)  

I’ve always thought it’d be awesome if Google could use it’s huge amount of data to make search results more powerful and [tailored to us](http://seanmonstar.com/2022/07/28/2012-01-10-personalizing-search.html). This is a [step](http://googleplusplatform.blogspot.com/2013/02/google-plus-sign-in.html) in that direction.

And yet, what’s the incentive to do this over the much larger install base of Facebook Connect? Also, looking at the documentation, it’s still easier (and more inclusive!) to just use [Persona](https://login.persona.org).
