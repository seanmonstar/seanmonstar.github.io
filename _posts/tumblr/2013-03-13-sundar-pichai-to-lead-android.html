<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2013/03/update-from-ceo.html">Sundar Pichai to lead Android</a><br/><p>Surprising in my eyes. It seems Andy Rubin really helped turn Android from the crap of FroYo and Gingerbread into the nice experience we have now in Jelly Bean.</p>

<p>Still, Chrome has been a successful project, and Sundar leads that also.</p>
