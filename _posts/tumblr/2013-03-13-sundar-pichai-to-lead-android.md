[Sundar Pichai to lead Android](http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2013/03/update-from-ceo.html)  

Surprising in my eyes. It seems Andy Rubin really helped turn Android from the crap of FroYo and Gingerbread into the nice experience we have now in Jelly Bean.

Still, Chrome has been a successful project, and Sundar leads that also.
