<p><em>I&rsquo;m a week late to the &ldquo;<a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html">Google Reader dies</a>&rdquo; news, but I wanted to collect my thoughts and read other people&rsquo;s knee-jerk reactions first.</em></p>

<p>I am quite interested in human data consumption. <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/2023/2010-09-03-prioritizing-my-tiny-inbox/">Obsessed</a>, even. Like, I constantly re-analyze my current setup, making sure I&rsquo;m getting all the information I want, while keep as much junk out as possible. Maybe sometimes also re-analyzing my obsession with information obsession.</p>

<h3>My Current Digs</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>I subscribe to high signal-to-noise blogs where I want to read just about every article using <strong>RSS</strong>. These are typically opinion blogs where I enjoy reading what the author has to say. Pretty much nothing in here talks about the latest news. Of all the available choice, I&rsquo;ve always used Google Reader, since&hellip; eh, who&rsquo;s kidding who, there was no other proper choice. It had the added benefit of being syncable with Flipboard, Feedly, and any other mobile feed reader I tried.</p></li>
<li><p>I get my latest news, and otherwise follow &ldquo;blogs&rdquo; or personas that post interesting links via <strong>Twitter</strong>. This seems like the least-worst way to battle all the noise, since I only have to see 140 characters to decide if it&rsquo;s interesting to me. Plus, if it&rsquo;s not, I don&rsquo;t need to bother with &ldquo;Mark All as Read&rdquo; bah-log-na.</p></li>
<li><p>That&rsquo;s it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>With Google Reader dying, I need a new place to move my &ldquo;must reads&rdquo; RSS subscriptions. Some of the Internet seems to think we shouldn&rsquo;t need that anymore, but I&rsquo;ve always seen my consumption as being from 2 buckets: <strong>high-signal must-reads</strong>, and <strong>abysmally low-signal may-be-interesting-but-oh-god-I&rsquo;m-sinking snacks</strong>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve put a lot of thought into this obsession, and have 2 key objectives when it comes my reading: try to never miss anything I&rsquo;d truly enjoy, and ruthlessly remove anything that I <em>won&rsquo;t</em> enjoy.</p>

<p>To that end, a couple years ago, I started working on my own idea of a feed reader, that would try to solve these issues, and not just be a simple interface on &ldquo;dumb pipes&rdquo;.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve likely heard of <a href="http://feedafever.com">Fever</a>. It has a cool concept of grouping sites together when they share links to a &ldquo;hot&rdquo; topic. I found this to be genius, but then was quickly let down when I wished it would do more. I didn&rsquo;t want a separate list of what&rsquo;s currently &ldquo;hot&rdquo;. I simply wanted to read my list at the end of the day, letting a tool group up articles that were talking about the same thing. That way, I could read them all at once, or <em>skip</em> them all at once, and have them removed from my river of news.</p>

<p>Additionally, I wanted something like Google Reader&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sort by magic&rdquo;, only that was magical about <strong>you</strong>, not the greater hive mind. So many times, it would tell me that an article on Smashing Magazine about &ldquo;Top jQuery Plugins&rdquo; was the most important thing to read. Clearly, it knew nothing about me.</p>

<p>So that was the goal of feedmonstar, and the prototype really started to do just that in an alpha state, before I got busy at Mozilla, plus my server was having issues as my &ldquo;magic&rdquo; sorting required a lot of memory to dynamically sort, score, and group the feed on each request.</p>

<p>If that sort of thing interests you, <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/about">get in contact with me</a>. I still have all the code, and could be bothered to set it up on another host to try and work on, if there&rsquo;s interest.</p>
