<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/google-keepsave-whats-on-your-mind.html">Google Keep</a><br/><p>After playing with Keep for a few days, here&rsquo;s my brief brain dump about it:</p>

<ul><li>The design is gorgeous!</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s oh-so-fast! Using the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep">widget</a>, it&rsquo;s near instantaneous to hit the the Record button, and be recording a new note that gets transcribed with barely an error. Compared to Evernote, which takes a couple seconds to get up and running with a new note.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s already integrated with Google Now. Just say &ldquo;Google, note to self&hellip;&rdquo;, and blam-o.</li>
<li>I use the widget as a super simple reminder system. I&rsquo;m terrible with todos, but occasionally need to remember to do a simple action when I get home, or when I wake up. The widget helps show me this reminders.</li>
<li>It integrates with <a href="https://drive.google.com/keep">Drive</a>, so you should be able to write and store decent notes or photos, and find them again.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s FUD about Google potentially shuttering Keep in the future, and while that may happen, I&rsquo;m not too worried. It&rsquo;s part of Drive, which is a for-pay product, like Dropbox. Plus, if they still decide to close it down, you can access all your files from Drive just like a normal file system. Drive can sync to your computer, so all your files are still there.</li>
<li>Android was in need of a default note/reminder app, and this fills it.</li>
<li><p>I look forward to the things Google could add to Keep to integrate even more with the Google eco-system. Like some of these suggestions from <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/20/4129140/google-keep-a-simple-note-taking-app-or-the-start-of-something-big">David Pierce</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We immediately had visions of being able to jot down notes with Keep and seamlessly email them out through Gmail, or convert the hastily-scribbled &ldquo;get lunch with Jane on Wednesday&rdquo; into a Calendar event. What if you could send photos from your Google Glass to your Keep stream, or jot down an address and then have Google Maps navigate you there later?</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
