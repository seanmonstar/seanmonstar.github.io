[Google Keep](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/google-keepsave-whats-on-your-mind.html)  

After playing with Keep for a few days, here’s my brief brain dump about it:

- The design is gorgeous!
- It’s oh-so-fast! Using the [widget](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.keep), it’s near instantaneous to hit the the Record button, and be recording a new note that gets transcribed with barely an error. Compared to Evernote, which takes a couple seconds to get up and running with a new note.
- It’s already integrated with Google Now. Just say “Google, note to self…”, and blam-o.
- I use the widget as a super simple reminder system. I’m terrible with todos, but occasionally need to remember to do a simple action when I get home, or when I wake up. The widget helps show me this reminders.
- It integrates with [Drive](https://drive.google.com/keep), so you should be able to write and store decent notes or photos, and find them again.
- There’s FUD about Google potentially shuttering Keep in the future, and while that may happen, I’m not too worried. It’s part of Drive, which is a for-pay product, like Dropbox. Plus, if they still decide to close it down, you can access all your files from Drive just like a normal file system. Drive can sync to your computer, so all your files are still there.
- Android was in need of a default note/reminder app, and this fills it.
- I look forward to the things Google could add to Keep to integrate even more with the Google eco-system. Like some of these suggestions from [David Pierce](http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/20/4129140/google-keep-a-simple-note-taking-app-or-the-start-of-something-big):
