<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Use your Existing Accounts</strong>. Weâ€™ve bridged yahoo.com, but of course we built an open system: any domain can now become a Persona Identity Provider so users can reuse their existing accounts on any site that uses Persona.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Built Into Firefox OS</strong>. We built in support for Firefox OS and made Persona much faster on all mobile devices. This gives Firefox OS apps an even better experience when using Persona.</p>
