[Persona Beta 2](http://identity.mozilla.com/post/47541633049/persona-beta-2)  

Oh yeah! So excited about all this hard work the team has put in. And it feels so good to know I helped on these features:

> **Use your Existing Accounts**. We’ve bridged yahoo.com, but of course we built an open system: any domain can now become a Persona Identity Provider so users can reuse their existing accounts on any site that uses Persona.
> 
> **Built Into Firefox OS**. We built in support for Firefox OS and made Persona much faster on all mobile devices. This gives Firefox OS apps an even better experience when using Persona.
