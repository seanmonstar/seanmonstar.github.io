[Great news](http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/17/4235696/new-star-wars-films-to-be-released-every-summer-beginning-with):

> [Disney] has just announced at CinemaCon that it will be releasing a new film in the universe every summer, starting in 2015.

I’m stoked. So this would mean:

- 2015: Episode VII
- 2016: Boba Fett?
- 2017: Episode VIII
- 2018: Han Solo?
- 2019: Episode IX
- etc
