<p>The Boston Marathon news is certainly a tragic thing, but to read about it on The Verge felt shockingly out of place. I wasn&rsquo;t alone. MG Siegler on the <a href="https://medium.com/writers-on-writing/94111dde5ca9">coverage of the Boston bombings on tech sites</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rather than directly send their readers to other places doing actual reporting, these sites all wrote at least one post (and in the case of Mashable, something like a dozen shameful posts) simply embedding, copying and pasting, or rejurgitating others’ information. And guess what they all got as a result? Pageview gold.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems the editor-in-chief disagrees, but then, of course he would. Still, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenrosenbaum/2013/04/16/the-verges-josh-topolsky-defends-boston-bombing-coverage/">his argument</a> seems obtusely wrong:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have never thought of ourselves as a “tech” site (and certainly not a “blog”).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ohhhhh rrrealllyyyy? Not a tech site, you say? Strange, how when I hit the home page, the &ldquo;sections&rdquo; show me &ldquo;web&rdquo;, &ldquo;gaming&rdquo;, &ldquo;apps&rdquo;, &ldquo;Apple&rdquo;, &ldquo;Android&rdquo;, &ldquo;mobile, and the like. What&rsquo;s their <a href="http://www.theverge.com/about-the-verge">About page</a> say?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Verge was founded in 2011 in partnership with Vox Media, and covers the intersection of technology, science, art, and culture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not tech? Alright, I get ya. Clearly, The Verge is about technology culture. <em>Being</em> a person who likes technology, and all that. But, you say the <strong>intersection</strong>. I used the think that meant &quot;when a story touches on all of these subjects&rdquo;, but now I&rsquo;m less certain.</p>

<p>Instead, his argument continues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We think of ourselves as a news site which covers the culture of now (for lack of a better term), the world at this moment, as it is — what matters to people who live and work in 2013.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So all the people who live in 2013 are interesting in the Asus Taichi tablet? Or that a Twitter exec didn&rsquo;t say no to a &lsquo;Twitter Home&rsquo;? Or Facebook hiring a Maps manager?</p>

<p>My wife lives in the same century as I do (I have to assume), and she doesn&rsquo;t care about any of these things. <em>I</em> care about them though. I also care about how Barcelona is doing in the Champions League, and how much I have to pay in taxes, but I wouldn&rsquo;t expect to find anything about those on The Verge.</p>

<p>I do see that how I (and much of the world) would be interested in the Boston bombing. We&rsquo;re also probably interested in what&rsquo;s currently happening in Egypt, and how the North Korea situation is proceeding. But I don&rsquo;t see anything about those on the Verge, except where they point out when insane world leaders take to Twitter. Interesting.</p>

<p>The Verge home page also had a huge box the same day of this timely article: &ldquo;<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/16/4228808/bomb-tech-defend-protect-against-explosives">Staying safe: how can we find and defend against explosives?</a>&rdquo; Say what? I came to read about tech. Sorry, not tech, but things interesting to a technologist. This is just a second article taking advantage of our human fear of blowing up.</p>

<p>In the following days, they have indeed had several articles about the tech related to the Boston situation, and that seems fine. Still, when it&rsquo;s not your field, simply link to the people who <em>do</em> report in that field. The same way we wish the LA Times would just point at a tech site instead of blabbering about something they don&rsquo;t understand.</p>
