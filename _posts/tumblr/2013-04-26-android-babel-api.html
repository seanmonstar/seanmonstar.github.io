<p>The communication situation on Android has gotten worse with the introduction of Google+. We used to have just Messaging (SMS), and Gtalk, and then they added Messenger. And they did this after Apple introduced iMessage, which simplified messaging. It seemed so counter-productive. So when I <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/10/4207894/google-babel-cross-platform-messaging-platform-rumors">read things like this</a>, I jump for joy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rumors have been swirling that Google is working on a cross-platform messaging service called Babel that will tie together all of its existing communication products, from Google Talk and Hangouts to Voice and Google+ Messenger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It sounds like it could fall slightly short of everything that I would hope for, though. Android is in a perfect place to make their system even better, for everyone, not only when in Googleland. Android already has an API to allow <em>any</em> app to sync their <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/contacts-provider.html">contact details</a> into your People app. What if they made a <strong>communication</strong> API, that any app could tie into, that would allow you to use just the native Android communication app, and be able to <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/2023/2011-04-18-universal-communicator/">talk to everyone on all platforms</a>. It could be SMS, Gtalk, WhatsApp, and Facebook, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have to care how.</p>

<p>Someone on the Android team, please do it!</p>

<p>Additionally, this global app <strong>needs</strong> to behave similar to Facebook&rsquo;s new Chatheads. Being able to keep browsing and doing other things while my chat is minimized, and then opening it partly to answer, and get right back to it: that is <em>the</em> way messaging must work on Android going forward. No butts.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed Android messaging more than iOS, and a big reason is because the Android Messaging app shows the person&rsquo;s picture next to their messages. For that reason, I&rsquo;ve always assigned people I message frequently with a photo, if they haven&rsquo;t chosen one themselves. This new API (call it Babel) would be really push it into the new age of text communication.</p>
