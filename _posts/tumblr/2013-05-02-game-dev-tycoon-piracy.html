<a href="http://www.greenheartgames.com/2013/04/29/what-happens-when-pirates-play-a-game-development-simulator-and-then-go-bankrupt-because-of-piracy/">The proper way to handle game piracy</a><br/><p>The makers of <a href="http://www.greenheartgames.com/app/game-dev-tycoon/">Game Dev Tycoon</a>, a game where players run a game development company, released a &ldquo;cracked&rdquo; version of their own game. It worked just fine, but as the pirates would play, they would start to see this beautiful message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Boss, it seems that while many players play our new game, they steal it by downloading a cracked version rather than buying it legally.
  If players don’t buy the games they like, we will sooner or later go bankrupt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>DRM done right.<sup id="fnref:p49476423777-1"><a href="#fn:p49476423777-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
