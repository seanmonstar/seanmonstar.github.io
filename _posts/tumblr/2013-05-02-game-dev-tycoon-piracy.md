[The proper way to handle game piracy](http://www.greenheartgames.com/2013/04/29/what-happens-when-pirates-play-a-game-development-simulator-and-then-go-bankrupt-because-of-piracy/)  

The makers of [Game Dev Tycoon](http://www.greenheartgames.com/app/game-dev-tycoon/), a game where players run a game development company, released a “cracked” version of their own game. It worked just fine, but as the pirates would play, they would start to see this beautiful message:

> Boss, it seems that while many players play our new game, they steal it by downloading a cracked version rather than buying it legally. If players don’t buy the games they like, we will sooner or later go bankrupt.

DRM done right.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
