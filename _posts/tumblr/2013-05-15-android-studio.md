[Android Studio: An IDE built for Android](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2013/05/android-studio-ide-built-for-android.html#__sid=0)  

A new IDE to use when developing for Android. Hopefully it’s easier to work with than [Eclipse](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/ios-vs-android-dev/). The way the code shows the resources dynamically and showing the icons in the side looks sweet, and the `NullPointerException` warnings look truly helpful.

I’m cautiously excited.
