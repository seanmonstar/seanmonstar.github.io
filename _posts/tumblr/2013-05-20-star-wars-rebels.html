<a href="http://starwars.com/news/new-animated-series-star-wars-rebels-coming-fall-2014.html">Star Wars Rebels</a><br/><p>I&rsquo;ve always thought it would be awesome to explore the time period between Episode III and IV. My imagination went into overdrive seeing the Correllian Corvette towards the end of Episode III, and The Force Unleashed got to show the rebels make a formal declaration, but I want more.</p>

<p>And now, next year, we get a CG TV show exploring exactly that. Considering Star Wars&rsquo; previous TV shows, this should not disappoint.</p>
