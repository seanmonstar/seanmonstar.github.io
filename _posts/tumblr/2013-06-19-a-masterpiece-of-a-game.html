<blockquote>
  <p>I think that may be the mark of a truly masterpiece game - when a game’s experience is so good, that I want to do it over and over, rather than needing new choices or paths to create new content and make it fresh again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s so true. Most new games claim replayability by having new choices to make, but I find that many times, the gameplay just wasn&rsquo;t amazing enough to play again with different choices. Yet, some games you play over and over, despite no new choices.</p>
