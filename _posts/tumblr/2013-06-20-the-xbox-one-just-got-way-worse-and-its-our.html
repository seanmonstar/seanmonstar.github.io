  <p>Cheaper games. Easier sharing. The end of discs. The Xbox One would have been just fine despite the chorus of haters, would have been a better system for ignoring them. Microsoft losing its nerve on this isn&rsquo;t just disappointing for the features we lose. It&rsquo;s unfortunate because it shows just how heavy an anchor we can be.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s clear that used games do more harm than good to gamers, so it&rsquo;s disappointing to see Microsoft bend to allow them. Worse, though, is that doing so made some of the futuristic features that we were going to enjoy got axed as well<sup id="fnref:p53478754175-1"><a href="#fn:p53478754175-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Granted, Microsoft should have done a way better job of showing off why their proposal was better for <strong>games</strong>, but oh well. There&rsquo;s still hope that we can still have some of these features by buying the games online.</p>
