['The Xbox One Just Got Way Worse, And It's Our Fault'](http://gizmodo.com/the-xbox-one-just-got-way-worse-and-its-our-fault-514411905)  

> Cheaper games. Easier sharing. The end of discs. The Xbox One would have been just fine despite the chorus of haters, would have been a better system for ignoring them. Microsoft losing its nerve on this isn’t just disappointing for the features we lose. It’s unfortunate because it shows just how heavy an anchor we can be.

It’s clear that used games do more harm than good to gamers, so it’s disappointing to see Microsoft bend to allow them. Worse, though, is that doing so made some of the futuristic features that we were going to enjoy got axed as well<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.

Granted, Microsoft should have done a way better job of showing off why their proposal was better for **games** , but oh well. There’s still hope that we can still have some of these features by buying the games online.
