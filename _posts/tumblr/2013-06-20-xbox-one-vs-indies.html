  <p>You need to pay a tithe to Microsoft Studios or a third-party developer if you want to be on the platform, and it&rsquo;s likely to cost you more money to avoid Xbox Live exclusivity.</p>

<p>This is disheartening. Some of the best games are from independent developers. My absolute favorite: Natural Selection 2. Also, this is why we can&rsquo;t have Dust 514 on Xbox. If Microsoft wants their <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/2013/06/20/the-xbox-one-just-got-way-worse-and-its-our.html-fault">digital future</a>, this needs to stop.</p>

<p>This is why we can&rsquo;t have nice things.</p>
