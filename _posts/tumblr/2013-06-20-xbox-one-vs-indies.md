[Xbox One vs. indies](http://penny-arcade.com/report/article/xbox-one-vs.-indies-microsoft-bullies-developers-into-signing-with-publishe)  

> You need to pay a tithe to Microsoft Studios or a third-party developer if you want to be on the platform, and it’s likely to cost you more money to avoid Xbox Live exclusivity.

This is disheartening. Some of the best games are from independent developers. My absolute favorite: Natural Selection 2. Also, this is why we can’t have Dust 514 on Xbox. If Microsoft wants their [digital future](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/2013-06-20-the-xbox-one-just-got-way-worse-and-its-our/-fault), this needs to stop.

This is why we can’t have nice things.
