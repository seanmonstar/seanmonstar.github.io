A couple months ago, I was blagging on about logging libraries in nodejs. After pointing out how annoying it is to use logging libraries with 3rd party modules, I [declared that all modules should simply use `console.log()`](http://seanmonstar.com/post/56448644049/console-log-all-the-things), and let applications hijack the console. Then, I looked around the npms, and couldn’t find an excellent example of a logging library that embraced that idea.

So, clearly, that meant I needed to write my own. It’s called [intel](http://seanmonstar.github.io/intel). Why another logging library? Well duh, cause this one is better.

### Loggers get names

Before nodejs, I came from Pythonia. Over yonder, they have an excellent [logging module](http://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html) as part of the standard library. It’s glorious. It uses hierarchal named loggers. [Winston](https://github.com/flatiron/winston), the library we currently use in [Persona](https://github.com/mozilla/browserid), while being perfectly awesome, doesn’t have support for this. It does allow you to define Containers and Categories, but it’s not as powerful as I’d like.

Specifically, intel adds 2 noteworthy features to Loggers: **hierarchy** and **humane setup**.

1. Loggers use an **hierarchy** based on their names. Logger `foo.bar` is a child of `foo`. So is `foo.bar.baz`. When a logger receives a log message, after handling itself, it passes the message up to its parents.

2. Of the other libraries I could fine that supported multiple named loggers, they all required that you instantiate the loggers with all options ahead of time. This adds more friction having a named logger per module in your app. Instead, intel makes it **super easy** for you get a new named logger.

### Powerful configuration

Named loggers allow for really powerful yet easy-to-use logging. Combined with a little bit of configuration, and it’s all magical. You can setup a couple root loggers, with various levels pumping messages to various handlers (Console, File, Email, Database, etc). You can see [an example](http://seanmonstar.github.io/intel#config) in the docs.

### Infiltrating the console

The motivating reason I started intel was to do exactly this. I want my apps to have the power to configure logging just the way I want, and I want all my dependencies to play along with my logging rules. So, after you setup your loggers and handlers, you can inject intel into the global `console` object, and watch as any dependencies that use `console.log` follow your rules, and automatically get assigned the correct names.

     intel.console();
     intel.getLogger('patrol.node_modules.express').setLevel(intel.WARN);
     // in express.js
     console.log('new request'); // automatically gets assigned to patrol.node_modules.express logger.

### intel

I’m starting by a 0.1 release of [intel](http://seanmonstar.github.io/intel). Any bugs or feature requests can filed in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/seanmonstar/intel/issues). I don’t want intel to be one of those libraries that is forever sub-1.0. After some use in the wild, with bugs being fixed and possibly APIs being made better, I’d like to get to a 1.0 soon.

So, try swapping out your current logger for intel. Name some loggers. You’ll come around.
