I’ve been on a [logging](http://seanmonstar.com/2022/07/28/2013-09-30-intel.html) [spree](http://seanmonstar.com/2022/07/28/2013-10-04-intel-0-2.html) [recently](http://seanmonstar.com/post/64887501509/intel-0-3), and after having spent some time on an [application logging module](http://seanmonstar.github.io/intel), I’ve been thinking about what libraries can do about logging. At first I said that libraries should just [dump everything into console.log](http://seanmonstar.com/2022/07/28/2013-07-25-console-log-all-the-things.html), but I can definitely see downsides to that.

### debug

[debug](https://npmjs.org/package/debug) is a popular utility that handles this problem of libraries wanting logging without annoying consumers quite well. You can use debug, name a logger, and log messages all you want. Unless a consumer adds en ENV variable to listen to those debug messages, it will be all quiet.

### dbug

[dbug](https://npmjs.org/package/dbug) works largely the same, with a few tweaks that I feel are really helpful, but I don’t think I’d have been able to convince TJ to include them in debug.

First of all, it’s a perfectly safe drop-in replacement for debug. It has the same API.

However, it adds a few familiar methods that you’d find on the `console` object, so you can classify the severity of particular dbug messages. Some may simply be `info` messages, while others are meant to signify when an `error` or `warn` has occurred. Still though, only if the consumer has opted-in to see your messages by setting `process.env.DEBUG`.

The log level will be included in the log message, so everyone can see the severity.

Additionally, the `DEBUG` matching is slightly more lenient. You can still use `*` and comma separated names, but additionally, specifying a name now implies any of it’s children.

`DEBUG=foo` will match `foo:bar`. Basically, every name is also the same as `name:*`.

### v0.1.0

[0.1](https://npmjs.org/package/dbug) is available now.

A few things I’ve been toying with adding to additional versions:

- `DEBUG=foo.warn` to only get warn or greater message from the `foo` logger.
- Allowing `.` to be a separate in log names also: `dbug('foo.bar')`.

And, currently next up is getting [intel](http://seanmonstar.github.io/intel) to play nice with debug/dbug.
