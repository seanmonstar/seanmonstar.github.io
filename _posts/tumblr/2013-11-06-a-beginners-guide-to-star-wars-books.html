  <p>So, let’s say you like Star Wars, and you’re curious, and that area of the bookstore is crazy, so you ask me what you should read to catch up with some of these folks after the movies.</p>
  
  <p>My answer is pretty simple: You read the Thrawn trilogy, aka Timothy Zahn’s <em>Heir to the Empire</em>, <em>Dark Force Rising</em>, and <em>The Last Command</em>. And then you stop.</p>

<p>I read far more Star Wars books than I ever should have. Some are truly awful. I enjoyed the X-Wing series, but somehow, <strong>somehow</strong>, I managed to miss the Thrawn trilogy.</p>

<p>I must rectify that. I found the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00513HX7Y/?tag=seanmonstar-20">ebook on Amazon</a>. Reading time. You should too!</p>
