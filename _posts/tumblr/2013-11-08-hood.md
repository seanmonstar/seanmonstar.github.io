It’s dangerous on the internet, use some security headers. No, really. If you’re making a webapp, you need some of them lovely headers. Headers such as CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options. I previously implemented these in our [Gmail Bridge](http://seanmonstar.com/blog/gmail-bridge-for-persona/), and then needed them again in another app. Copy over the headers code? Nonsense! That’s what libraries are for.

### hood

[![hood](https://64.media.tumblr.com/d64fa6deffc201b0b621774fc4668877/tumblr_inline_mvygl1Mpb31qzek7l.png)](https://npmjs.org/package/hood)

You can use [hood](https://npmjs.org/package/hood) without any configuration, and it will use sane defaults that most apps will want to enforce security-wise. You can also pass options to `hood(options)` to configure parts to be different than default, or you can use each header individually, such as `hood.csp()`.

Included middlewares:

- csp
- hsts
- xframe
- nosniff

### Why didn’t I just use Helmet?

- helmet doesn’t by default use the `Content-Security-Policy` header for it’s `csp` middleware, which is now the standard.
- I only expected to setup the middleware once, so needing to do pre-setup for `helmet.csp` by adding and configuring policies felt wrong. `hood.csp` just accepts policy options, so you can use it once and be done.

### v0.1.1

Cover your head, [v0.1.1](https://npmjs.org/package/hood).
