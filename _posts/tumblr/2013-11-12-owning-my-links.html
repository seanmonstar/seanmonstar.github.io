<p>I&rsquo;ve always just blasted links I find interesting onto <a href="http://twitter.com/seanmonstar">Twitter</a>, or increasingly via <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/tent">Tent</a>, and I started to realize that I didn&rsquo;t really own these links. I had no collection, no way to easily make them appear elsewhere. Especially after I read this <a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/07/11/hookingGoogleplusToMyLinkb.html">piece by Dave Winer about owning your links</a>, and seeing his <a href="http://links.scripting.com">linkblog</a>, I was inspired.</p>

<p>So now my links are my own. They live at <a href="http://links.seanmonstar.com">links.seanmonstar.com</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not actually on my servers, but hosted on Tumblr, since sharing links is so easy there. However, the source lives under a domain I control. And for backup, I use <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/128066">IFTTT to save every link to my &ldquo;links&rdquo; note in Evernote</a>.</p>

<p>This means that an <a href="http://links.seanmonstar.com/rss">RSS feed</a> is available. I&rsquo;m currently syndicating them to <a href="http://twitter.com/seanmonstar">Twitter</a>. I&rsquo;m looking into how to do so with <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/tent">Tent</a>, and if <a href="https://plus.google.com/+SeanMcArthur">Google+</a> ever joins us in the syndicated web, there too.</p>
