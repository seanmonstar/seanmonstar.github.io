I’ve always just blasted links I find interesting onto [Twitter](http://twitter.com/seanmonstar), or increasingly via [Tent](http://seanmonstar.com/tent), and I started to realize that I didn’t really own these links. I had no collection, no way to easily make them appear elsewhere. Especially after I read this [piece by Dave Winer about owning your links](http://scripting.com/stories/2011/07/11/hookingGoogleplusToMyLinkb.html), and seeing his [linkblog](http://links.scripting.com), I was inspired.

So now my links are my own. They live at [links.seanmonstar.com](http://links.seanmonstar.com).

It’s not actually on my servers, but hosted on Tumblr, since sharing links is so easy there. However, the source lives under a domain I control. And for backup, I use [IFTTT to save every link to my “links” note in Evernote](https://ifttt.com/recipes/128066).

This means that an [RSS feed](http://links.seanmonstar.com/rss) is available. I’m currently syndicating them to [Twitter](http://twitter.com/seanmonstar). I’m looking into how to do so with [Tent](http://seanmonstar.com/tent), and if [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+SeanMcArthur) ever joins us in the syndicated web, there too.
