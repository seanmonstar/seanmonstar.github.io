<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.monstarlab.countmonstar">Tally</a><br/><p>I had need of a simple counter application on my phone, and I scoured the Play Store for a good one. They all have atrocious UIs, with far too many buttons and features. I found <em>one</em> that was nicely designed, Tap Counter, but the touch target was too small, only directly in the center, making it very easy to miss when counting people and not looking at the screen.</p>

<p>So, over the weekend, I made <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.monstarlab.countmonstar">one</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a simple, beautiful Holo design. It picks from one of the Android Holo colors for the circle up app launch, so it will change up each time you use it. There&rsquo;s only one button, and it takes up the whole screen. To reset, simply hold down that button, and you&rsquo;ll get a fun animation.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. That&rsquo;s <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.monstarlab.countmonstar">Tally</a>.</p>
