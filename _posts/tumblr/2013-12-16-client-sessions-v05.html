<a href="https://github.com/mozilla/node-client-sessions/releases/tag/v0.5.0">client-sessions v0.5</a><br/><p>It rather bothered me that <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/client-sessions">client-sessions</a> required a native module, but it used a Proxy so as to only re-encrypt the cookie if it a property changed. Stuck 30,000 feet in the air unnaturally, I spent some time removing the usage of the Proxy, and use getters and setters instead.</p>

<p>I also mopped up some bugs while I was at it.</p>

<p>So, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/node-client-sessions/releases/tag/v0.5.0">v0.5</a> is live, works better, and such!</p>
