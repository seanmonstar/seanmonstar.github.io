<p>I released <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/intel/releases/tag/v0.4.0">v0.4</a> of <a href="https://seanmonstar.github.io/intel">intel</a> last month, but never got around to writing up what&rsquo;s new.</p>

<h3>debug/dbug</h3>

<p>I started out all this logging business <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/post/56448644049/console-log-all-the-things">claiming we should console.log()</a> all the things. intel can easily handle any libaries using <code>console.log</code>. However, I started to see how frustrating it could be for libraries to be spilling logs all over stdout without being asked. <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/post/65083195617/dbug-v0-1">dbug</a> is a utility for libraries to provide logging, but to be quiet by default.</p>

<p>intel v0.4 includes the ability to play nice with dbug (and debug). You can call <code>intel.console({ debug: someStr })</code> to turn on dbug in libraries matching your string. Due to how debug works, by checking an environment variable right when it is required, you&rsquo;ll need to run <code>intel.console()</code> <em>before</em> requiring any library that uses debug.</p>

<h3>performance</h3>

<p>As with every release, things get faster. According to meaningless benchmarks, we&rsquo;re now ~2x faster than winston. Whatever that means.</p>

<h3>syslog</h3>

<p>Not part of the actual release, but released at the same time, is an <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/intel-syslog">intel-syslog</a> library. This provides a simple syslog handler that you can easily use in your app.</p>

<pre><code>require('intel').config({

  handlers: {
    'syslog': {
      'class': 'intel-syslog',
      'address': '127.0.0.1',
      'facility': 'user' //etc...
    }
  },

  loggers: {
    'myapp': {
      'handlers': ['syslog']
    }
  }

});
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;ve created a <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/intel/wiki/Custom-Handlers">wiki page to contain handlers</a> such as intel-syslog that work with intel. If you create or find a library for intel, please add it to the list so we all can be happier logging things.</p>
