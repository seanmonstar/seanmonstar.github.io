I released [v0.4](https://github.com/seanmonstar/intel/releases/tag/v0.4.0) of [intel](https://seanmonstar.github.io/intel) last month, but never got around to writing up what’s new.

### debug/dbug

I started out all this logging business [claiming we should console.log()](http://seanmonstar.com/post/56448644049/console-log-all-the-things) all the things. intel can easily handle any libaries using `console.log`. However, I started to see how frustrating it could be for libraries to be spilling logs all over stdout without being asked. [dbug](http://seanmonstar.com/post/65083195617/dbug-v0-1) is a utility for libraries to provide logging, but to be quiet by default.

intel v0.4 includes the ability to play nice with dbug (and debug). You can call `intel.console({ debug: someStr })` to turn on dbug in libraries matching your string. Due to how debug works, by checking an environment variable right when it is required, you’ll need to run `intel.console()` _before_ requiring any library that uses debug.

### performance

As with every release, things get faster. According to meaningless benchmarks, we’re now ~2x faster than winston. Whatever that means.

### syslog

Not part of the actual release, but released at the same time, is an [intel-syslog](https://github.com/seanmonstar/intel-syslog) library. This provides a simple syslog handler that you can easily use in your app.

    require('intel').config({
    
      handlers: {
        'syslog': {
          'class': 'intel-syslog',
          'address': '127.0.0.1',
          'facility': 'user' //etc...
        }
      },
    
      loggers: {
        'myapp': {
          'handlers': ['syslog']
        }
      }
    
    });

I’ve created a [wiki page to contain handlers](https://github.com/seanmonstar/intel/wiki/Custom-Handlers) such as intel-syslog that work with intel. If you create or find a library for intel, please add it to the list so we all can be happier logging things.
