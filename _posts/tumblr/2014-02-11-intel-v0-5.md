[intel](http://seanmonstar.github.io/intel) is turning into an even more awesome logging framework than before, as if that was possible! Today, I released version [0.5.0](https://github.com/seanmonstar/intel/releases/tag/v0.5.0), and am now here to hawk it’s newness. You can check out the [full changelog](https://github.com/seanmonstar/intel/releases/tag/v0.5.0) yourself, but I want to highlight a couple bits.

### JSON function strings

[intel.config](http://seanmonstar.github.io/intel/#full-configuration) is really powerful when coupled with some JSON config files, but Formatters and Filters were never 100% in `config`, because you could pass a custom function to either to customize to your little kidney’s content. It’s not possible to include typical functions in JSON. Much sad face. So, the `formatFn` and `filterFn` options allow you to write a function in a string, and intel will try to parse it into a function. Such JSON.

### Logger.trace

A new lowest level was introduced, lower than even VERBOSE, and that’s TRACE. Likewise, `Logger.trace` behaves like `console.trace`, providing a stack trace with your message. If you don’t enable loggers with TRACE level logging, then no stacks will be traced, and everything will choo-choo along snappy-like.

### Full dbug integration

This is the goods. intel is an awesome _application_ logging library, since it lets you powerfully and easily be a logging switchboard: everything you want to know goes everywhere you want. However, stand-alone libraries have no business deciding where logs go. Libraries should simply provide logging when asked to, and shut up otherwise. That’s why libraries should use something like dbug. Since [v0.4](http://seanmonstar.com/2022/07/28/2014-01-02-intel-0-4.html), intel has been able to integrate somewhat with [dbug](http://seanmonstar.com/2022/07/28/2013-10-25-dbug-v0-1.html), but with 0.5, it can hook directly into it, meaning less bugs, and better performance. Examples!

    // hood/lib/csp.js
    var dbug = require('dbug')('hood:csp');
    
    exports.csp = function csp(options) {
        dbug('csp options:', options);
        if (!options.policy) {
            dbug.warn('no policy provided. are you sure?');
        }
        // ...
    };
    
    // myapp/server.js
    var intel = require('intel');
    intel.console({ debug: 'hood' });
    // will see: 'myapp.node_modules.hood.csp:DEBUG csp options: {}'

Dare I say, using [intel](http://seanmonstar.github.io/intel) and [dbug](http://seanmonstar.com/2022/07/28/2013-10-25-dbug-v0-1.html) together gives the best logging solution for libraries and apps.
