<p>Since I <a href="http://seanmonstar.com/2023/2014-12-18-hyper/">announced hyper</a> in December of last year, it has continued to grow as Rust&rsquo;s http library.</p>

<h3>highlights</h3>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a> was added!<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
<li>Many more of the common headers have been implemented.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/commits/master?author=pyfisch">Pyfisch has been slaving away</a> at cleaning up the headers modules.</li>
<li>A switch to using <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/commit/b87bb20f0c25891c30ef2399da2721596fbc1fcf">httparse</a> for HTTP/1.x parsing with wonderful speed gains.</li>
<li>Reem wrote up a <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/commit/3528fb9b015a0959268452d5b42d5544c7b98a6a">faster threadpool</a> for the Server.</li>
<li><strong>We compile on rustc beta!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, a lot of the effort this past few months has been keeping up with all the changes to Rust and the standard library. A million thanks to <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/graphs/contributors">all those who helped</a> with these upgrades. I can&rsquo;t overstate the joy it is to wake up in the morning, read that there are breaking changes in the latest nightly, and then see in my inbox that a pull request has already been filed fixing hyper.</p>

<h3>up next</h3>

<p>Now that the breaking changes are behind us, developement can focus entirely on making hyper do things better-er. Specifically, here&rsquo;s things that are either in progress, or highly desired (hint hint).</p>

<ul>
<li>The Client is very close to receiving <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/363">Connection Pool</a> support. Code is in a branch.</li>
<li>The Server is switching to a request queue, such that keep-alive connections don&rsquo;t <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/368">starve the server</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://mlalic.blogspot.com/2015/03/solicit-http2-library-for-rust.html">Marko Lalic has written an HTTP/2 library in Rust</a>. Many have stated wanting to help <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/304">integrate it into hyper</a>. Hopefully, this should happen soon!</li>
<li>We&rsquo;d like to switch to <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/395">asynchronous IO</a>. There&rsquo;s been plenty of working happening in <a href="https://github.com/carllerche/mio">mio</a>, which brings us async IO for Unix-y platforms. There&rsquo;s need for a Windows async IO library, and a library that can wrap the two. Then we can start switching over, and that means more speeeed.</li>
</ul>

<p>I could imagine aiming for a 1.0 of hyper once we have asynchronous IO.</p>

<p>Again, all of this is <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/graphs/contributors">thanks to you guys</a>, the amazing community. And if you want to get involved, please join in. Perhaps try tackling one of the <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/labels/easy">easy</a> issues first.</p>
