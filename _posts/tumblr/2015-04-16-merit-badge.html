<p>Are you jealous of the badges that npm modules or rubygems have, showing off their latest published version? Of course you are. I was too. When looking at a repository, the version may change as code is merged in, before being published to crates.io. Now, instead of looking at a repo and wondering what version is latest, that repo can add a crates.io badge.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s hyper&rsquo;s: <a href="https://crates.io/crates/hyper"><img src="http://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/hyper" alt="crates.io"/></a></p>

<p>Besides wanting to be able to use badges like these for my own repositories, I also wanted a <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/merit">simple example</a> of using <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper">hyper</a> to create a simple app. Bonus points: it users the hyper Server and Client, together.</p>

<p>Go ahead, <a href="http://meritbadge.herokuapp.com">get your merit badge</a>.</p>
