Are you jealous of the badges that npm modules or rubygems have, showing off their latest published version? Of course you are. I was too. When looking at a repository, the version may change as code is merged in, before being published to crates.io. Now, instead of looking at a repo and wondering what version is latest, that repo can add a crates.io badge.

Here’s hyper’s: [![crates.io](http://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/hyper)](https://crates.io/crates/hyper)

Besides wanting to be able to use badges like these for my own repositories, I also wanted a [simple example](https://github.com/seanmonstar/merit) of using [hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper) to create a simple app. Bonus points: it users the hyper Server and Client, together.

Go ahead, [get your merit badge](http://meritbadge.herokuapp.com).
