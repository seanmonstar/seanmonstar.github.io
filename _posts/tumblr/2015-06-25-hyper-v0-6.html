<p>A bunch of goodies are included in <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/releases/tag/v0.6.0">version 0.6</a> of hyper.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Experimental HTTP2 support for the Client!</strong> Thanks to tireless work of <a href="https://github.com/mlalic">@mlalic</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Redesigned <code>Ssl</code> support.</strong> The <code>Server</code> and <code>Client</code> can accept any implementation of the <code>Ssl</code> trait. By default, hyper comes with an implementation for OpenSSL, but this can now be disabled via the <code>ssl</code> cargo feature.</li>
<li><strong>A thread safe <code>Client</code></strong>. As in, <code>Client</code> is <code>Sync</code>. You can share a <code>Client</code> over multiple threads, and make several requests simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>Just about 90% test coverage.</strong> <a href="https://github.com/winding-lines">@winding-lines</a> has been bumping the number ever higher.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, as a reminder, hyper has been following semver more closely, and so, breaking changes mean bumping the minor version (until 1.0). So, to reduce unplanned breakage, you should probably depend on a specific minor version, such as <code>0.6</code>, and not <code>*</code>.</p>
