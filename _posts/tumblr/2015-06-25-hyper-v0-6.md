A bunch of goodies are included in [version 0.6](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/releases/tag/v0.6.0) of hyper.

### Highlights

- **Experimental HTTP2 support for the Client!** Thanks to tireless work of [@mlalic](https://github.com/mlalic).
- **Redesigned `Ssl` support.** The `Server` and `Client` can accept any implementation of the `Ssl` trait. By default, hyper comes with an implementation for OpenSSL, but this can now be disabled via the `ssl` cargo feature.
- **A thread safe `Client`**. As in, `Client` is `Sync`. You can share a `Client` over multiple threads, and make several requests simultaneously.
- **Just about 90% test coverage.** [@winding-lines](https://github.com/winding-lines) has been bumping the number ever higher.

Also, as a reminder, hyper has been following semver more closely, and so, breaking changes mean bumping the minor version (until 1.0). So, to reduce unplanned breakage, you should probably depend on a specific minor version, such as `0.6`, and not `*`.
