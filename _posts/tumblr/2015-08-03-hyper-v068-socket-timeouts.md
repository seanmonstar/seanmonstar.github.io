[hyper v0.6.8 - Socket Timeouts](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/releases/tag/v0.6.8)  

The newest release of hyper includes an unstable feature to set read and write timeouts for those of your daring enough to live on nightly. To do so, youâ€™ll need to enable the `timeouts` cargo feature:

    [dependencies.hyper]
    version = "0.6.8"
    features = "timeouts"

And then you can set them on a `Client` or `Server`:

    let mut client = Client::new();
    client.set_read_timeout(Some(Duration::from_secs(30));
    client.set_write_timeout(Some(Duration::from_secs(30));
    
    // ... or a server
    let mut server = Server::http(addr).unwrap();
    server.set_read_timeout(Some(Duration::from_secs(10));
    server.set_write_timeout(Some(Duration::from_secs(10));
