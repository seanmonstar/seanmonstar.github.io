<h3>Bye, Mozilla</h3>

<p>Today is my last day as a <a href="https://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> employee.</p>

<p>It hurts to say that. I love Mozilla.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>I loved waking up to work knowing that I was working for <strong>you</strong>. For everyone&rsquo;s internet. Truly, even if you feel Firefox is inferior to your preferred browser, you must admit that an internet ruled by profit-driven businesses is not a dream of anyone. What Mozilla does, by working to provide an alternative browser choice, is allow a non-profit organization to have a voice. Without <a href="https://firefox.com">Firefox</a>, the group of people that make up Mozilla would just be yelling at the closed doors of &ldquo;tech giants&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I got to work on some amazing technology, and with superb humans. The concept of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/Mozilla/Persona">Persona</a> is exactly the kind of thing that Mozilla&rsquo;s voice can push for: a way to fix passwords, while curbing identity providers from tracking your every action. Unfortunately, we couldn&rsquo;t get enough adoption before we realized that Firefox needed more help. Firefox was hurting, and without Firefox, well, our voice doesn&rsquo;t mean much. I dream that we can attack that problem again someday.</p>

<p>Taking our Identity team off Persona, we boosted Firefox Sync from a nerd toy into something that all Firefox users could benefit from. This actually quite important, something that can often times be forgotten even inside the organization. With Sync benefiting from <a href="https://accounts.firefox.com">Firefox Accounts</a>, users gain a whole lot more value from installing Firefox on multiple devices. Firefox&rsquo;s Awesomebar is still far better at finding things than Chrome does, and in my own experience, it&rsquo;s only gotten better since it can remember links I open on my phone or tablet.</p>

<p>The superb humans really are superb. Yes, they&rsquo;re intelligent. But that&rsquo;s the boring part. Many people are. They stand out, instead, because of their empathy, their optimism, their voice, their loyalty. My <a href="http://fxa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#people-and-places">team members</a> are loyal to each other, because each of us is loyal to the mission: a free, open internet where the user is in command. We all wanted each other to succeed, because that always meant wins for you, the user.</p>

<p>And yet, it&rsquo;s time for me start the next step in my journey. I still wish Mozilla the very best. You should definitely be using <a href="https://firefox.com">Firefox</a>. And I hope I&rsquo;ll bump into my friends plenty of times more in the future.</p>

<h3>Hello, Buoyant</h3>

<p>Starting Monday, I&rsquo;ll be working for <a href="https://buoyant.io">Buoyant</a>.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, I&rsquo;ve been learning and writing <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a>. I&rsquo;ve really dug into the community<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, and been absolutely loving working on tools for <a href="https://github.com/carllerche/http">HTTP</a> and <a href="https://hyper.rs">servers</a> and <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest">clients</a> and whatnot.</p>

<p>Buoyant is working on tools that help big websites scale. One such tool is <a href="https://linkerd.io">linkerd</a>, described as a service mesh. This tool is to help websites that are receiving godzillions of requests, and so needs to be fast and use little memory. Also, it&rsquo;s 2017, and so releasing a new tool that has CVEs about memory unsafety every couple months isn&rsquo;t really acceptable, when we have alternatives. So, Rust!</p>

<p>It turns out, we&rsquo;re a great fit! I&rsquo;ll be continuing to work on HTTP pieces in Rust. In fact, this means I&rsquo;ll now be working in Rust full-time, so hopefully pieces should be built faster. I&rsquo;ll be working in open source still, so hey, perhaps <em>you</em> will still benefit!</p>

<p>This is a really sad day for me, but I&rsquo;m also super excited for next week!<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been at Mozilla for over 6 years! It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m leaving part of my family, part of how I identify myself in the world. Not many places really grip you personally like Mozilla does. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>

<p>I really tried to get into the nodejs community a few years ago, but eventually ran into enough cases of elitism that I gave up. Thankfully, the Rust community is fantastic any way I can measure. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
