After a few months of [alpha development](https://seanmonstar.com/2022/07/28/2019-09-04-hyper-alpha-supports-asyncawait.html), the final release of [hyper v0.13.0](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/releases/tag/v0.13.0) is now ready! [hyper](https://hyper.rs) is a maturing HTTP library written in Rust, already one of the [fastest out there](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r18&hw=ph&test=plaintext)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and trusted by many for its correctness.

The highlights of this release:

- Full `async`/`await` support.
- Tokio v0.2 upgrade.
- Adopting `tower::Service`.

### async / await

The premise of `async` and `await` in Rust is to allow writing code that uses `Future`s in a similar style to “blocking” code. No more combinators, no more “callbacks”, just slap `.await` on the end of the expression. For instance, here’s how we can use the `Client`:

    #[tokio::main]
    async fn main() -> Result {
        let client = Client::new();
    
        let mut resp = client.get("http://httpbin.org/ip".parse()?).await?;
        println!("Status: {}", resp.status());
        println!("Headers: {:#?}\n", resp.headers());
    
        while let Some(chunk) = resp.body_mut().data().await {
            stdout().write_all(&chunk?).await?;
        }
    
        Ok(())
    }

Connecting, writing the request, receiving the response, streaming the body, and writing to stdout can all be done without “blocking” the thread. Instead, with the use of `await`, just _that_ future will make as much progress as it can without blocking, and then go to a pending state and register a notification when more progress could be made. And yet, it looks just like regular “blocking” code. This should _hugely_ improve the ergonomics of writing server code that scales under load.

### Tokio v0.2

[Tokio](https://tokio.rs) is a phenomenal async IO runtime for Rust, and hyper has built-in support by default. The [Tokio v0.2 upgrade](https://tokio.rs/blog/2019-11-tokio-0-2/) includes `async`/`await` support, a [significant scheduler improvement](https://tokio.rs/blog/2019-10-scheduler/), and even faster compile times.

### Tower Services

[Tower](https://github.com/tower-rs/tower) is an RPC design that builds off Twitter’s “your server as a function”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. It defines the base `Service` trait, which handles some request-like value, and asynchronously returns a response-like value. The `tower-service` crate is minimal, and protocol-agnostic. Our hope is others in the ecosystem can be just use `Service` and `http`, and not have to depend directly on hyper<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.

An additional benefit of integrating with Tower is being able to make use of many of the [middleware](https://github.com/tower-rs/tower) we’ve already developed.

- Server middleware:

- Or wrapping a Client:

Additionally, most `async fn(In) -> Out` things in hyper are now just a `Service`. This means you can easily add these middleware to custom resolvers or connectors, for instance. Uses include adding a timeout or whitelist to a resolver.

### v0.13.0

This probably the most exciting release of hyper yet. It’s all thanks to the 30+ contributors tireless efforts this release that we’ve gotten this far. Our production users continue to help us improve hyper’s correctness, performance, and features. The current goal is that we can finish up the remaining design questions and release hyper 1.0 in the middle of 2020.
