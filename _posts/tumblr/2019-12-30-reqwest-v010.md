[reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) is a higher-level HTTP client for Rust. Let me introduce you the [v0.10](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/releases/tag/v0.10.0) release that adds `async`/`await` support!

Some headline features are:

- Add `std::future::Future` support (hello `async`/`await`).
- Add experimental WASM support.
- Change the default client API to async, moving the previous synchronous API to `reqwest::blocking`.
- Make many “extra” features optional to reduce unnecessary dependencies (`blocking`, `cookies`, `gzip`, `json`, etc).
- Enable automatic “system” proxy detection.

Here’s a simple streaming example using the new syntax:

    async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
        let mut resp = reqwest::get("https://hyper.rs").await?;
    
        while let Some(chunk) = resp.chunk().await? {
            stdout().write_all(&chunk).await?;
        }
    
        Ok(())
    } 

I want to thank all those contributing to make the best Rust HTTP client even better!

Take a look at the [changelog](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/releases/tag/v0.10.0) for all the details.
