[Warp](https://crates.io/crates/warp) is a Rust web server framework focusing on composability and strongly-typed APIs.

Today sees the release of [v0.2](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp/releases/tag/v0.2.0)!

### Async and Await

The most exciting part of this release is the upgrade to `std::future`, so you can now use `async`/`await` for cleaner flow control. Due to how warp encourages composition of filters, this is most noticeable at the “ends” of a filter chain, where an application is doing its “business logic”, converting input into actions and replies. And that’s where most of the app code is!

### Services

In the [original release of warp](https://seanmonstar.com/blog/2018-08-01-warp/), I wrote:

As part of this release, that is now possible! Any `Filter` which returns a `Reply` can now be converted into a `Service` using `warp::service(filter)`. This means you can wrap your filters with any of the growing middlewares, as described in the [hyper v0.13 announcement](https://seanmonstar.com/blog/2019-12-10-hyper-v013/).

### Thanks

This was a lot of work by [over 60 new contributors](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp/graphs/contributors), including the massive `std::future` refactor by new collaborator [@jxs](https://github.com/jxs).

Be sure to check the [changelog](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp/releases/tag/v0.2.0) for all the goodies!
