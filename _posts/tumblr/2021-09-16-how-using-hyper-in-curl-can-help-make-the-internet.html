<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/how-using-hyper-in-curl-can-help-make-the-internet-safer/">How using hyper in curl can help make the internet safer</a><br/><p>Earlier in the year, I wrote about the ongoing effort to make <a href="https://hyper.rs">hyper</a> the HTTP backend for <a href="https://curl.se">curl</a>, over on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/how-using-hyper-in-curl-can-help-make-the-internet-safer/">AWS open source blog</a>. The article touches on these topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>The not-so-safe Internet</li>
<li>curl is everywhere</li>
<li>hyper has entered the chat</li>
</ul>

<p>So, yea, we&rsquo;re trying to make the <em>internet</em> <strong>safer</strong>! The implications are global. And the work is still on-going.</p>

<p>You could also just go <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okGUxW_i9yk">watch webinar recording</a>.</p>
