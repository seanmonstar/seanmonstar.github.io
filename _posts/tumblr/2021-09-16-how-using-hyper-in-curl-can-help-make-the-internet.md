[How using hyper in curl can help make the internet safer](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/how-using-hyper-in-curl-can-help-make-the-internet-safer/)  

Earlier in the year, I wrote about the ongoing effort to make [hyper](https://hyper.rs) the HTTP backend for [curl](https://curl.se), over on the [AWS open source blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/how-using-hyper-in-curl-can-help-make-the-internet-safer/). The article touches on these topics:

- The not-so-safe Internet
- curl is everywhere
- hyper has entered the chat

So, yea, weâ€™re trying to make the _internet_ **safer**! The implications are global. And the work is still on-going.
