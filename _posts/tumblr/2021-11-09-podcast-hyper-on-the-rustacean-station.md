[Podcast: hyper on the Rustacean Station](https://rustacean-station.org/episode/045-sean-arthur/)  

I spoke with Allen Wyma for a little over an hour on the [Rustacean Station podcast](https://rustacean-station.org/episode/045-sean-arthur/). Topics included:

- The history of [hyper.rs](https://hyper.rs)
- Async vs blocking HTTP
- hyper’s support for different environments
- [hyper in curl](https://seanmonstar.com/blog/2021-09-16-how-using-hyper-in-curl-can-help-make-the-internet/)
- Writing Rust code for C consumption
- HTTP/3
- hyper’s future

Probably my favorite part is at the end: advice for newcomers to Rust.
