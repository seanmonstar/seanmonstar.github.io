<p>We&rsquo;ve been working for that past year and change to allow <a href="https://seanmonstar.com/2023/2021-09-16-how-using-hyper-in-curl-can-help-make-the-internet/">hyper to be an HTTP backend for curl</a>. <strong>We&rsquo;re so close to having it work!</strong> With hundreds of tests working, there&rsquo;s only a dozen or so tests left to fix. I&rsquo;ve created a <a href="https://github.com/orgs/hyperium/projects/2/views/1"><strong>dashboard</strong></a> based on the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/tests/data/DISABLED">actual file</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Want to help us get it over the finish line?</strong> I&rsquo;ve written up a guide of how to help debug these tests, step-by-step<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and then included an example of a test I debugged.</p>

<h3>Build hyper&rsquo;s C API</h3>

<p>First, we&rsquo;ll build <code>libhyper</code>. Start by checking out hyper with git:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper">https://github.com/hyperium/hyper</a>
$ cd hyper
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we build the C library specifically, following the <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/master/capi/README.md">instructions</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ RUSTFLAGS="--cfg hyper_unstable_ffi" cargo +nightly rustc --features client,http1,http2,ffi -Z unstable-options --crate-type cdylib
</code></pre>

<h3>Build curl with hyper</h3>

<p>Now to use that to build curl. Get back to your normal code directory, and checkout curl:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl">https://github.com/curl/curl</a>
$ cd curl
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you have the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/GIT-INFO">required software already installed</a>. In my case, I needed to install autoconf and libtool.</p>

<p>Then, follow the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/docs/HYPER.md">in-repo instructions</a>:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./buildconf
$ ./configure --with-hyper=&lt;full path to hyper dir&gt;` --disable-shared --enable-debug 
$ make
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH="&lt;hyper dir&gt;/target/debug:/usr/local/lib" make test
</code></pre>

<p>When running <code>./configure</code>, you&rsquo;ll also need to select a TLS option. Since I was on Linux, I added on <code>--with-openssl</code>. For ease, you can pick <code>--with-secure-transport</code> on macOS, <code>--with-schannel</code> on Windows, or pick any of the other options if you know better. I wanted to be able to try the built curl on the regular web, but if you don&rsquo;t care about that, you can also just use <code>--without-ssl</code> to skip the TLS decision entirely.</p>

<h3>Pick a test from the list.</h3>

<p>Look at the<a href="https://github.com/orgs/hyperium/projects/2/views/1">dashboard of remaining tests</a>.</p>

<h3>Debug it!</h3>

<p>Once you have the test number picked, you can run it specifically:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd tests
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH="&lt;hyper dir&gt;/target/debug:/usr/local/lib" ./runtests.pl &lt;test number&gt; -f
</code></pre>

<p>And&hellip; it will have failed. But we expected that! Now for debugging.  Run it again with the debugger flag <code>-g</code>, which will use <code>gdb</code> to help us debug:</p>

<pre><code>$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH="&lt;hyper dir&gt;/target/debug:/usr/local/lib" ./runtests.pl &lt;test number&gt; -f -g
</code></pre>

<p>When prompted, enter <code>run</code> (or just <code>r</code>). Pay attention to output to give hints about where look in the code. Some useful gdb tips:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>break c-hyper.c:&lt;line-no&gt;</code> to set a breakpoint for a specific line in the <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/c-hyper.c"><code>c-hyper.c</code></a> file.</li>
<li><code>n</code> for the next line after breaking.</li>
<li><code>p &lt;expression&gt;</code> to print the value of an expression inside the function.</li>
<li><code>c</code> to continue (unbreak).</li>
</ul>

<p>It&rsquo;s a cycle of paying attention to the output, looking in the source code, checking the documentation, setting or adjusting breakpoints, and running again. Eventually, you can figure out what went wrong.</p>

<h3>An Example</h3>

<p>I randomly picked unit test 670 and ran it in the debugger. I saw this interesting line of output:</p>

<pre><code>* Hyper: [1] error from user's HttpBody stream: body write aborted
</code></pre>

<p>I realized that error message was a bit vague, so I updated it in hyper, and a re-run now shows this more useful message:</p>

<pre><code>* Hyper: [1] user body write aborted: early end, expected 49 more bytes
</code></pre>

<p>The request body is emitting some bytes, and then returning that the body is ended, while hyper thinks that 49 more bytes are needed to meet the advertized <code>content-length</code> header.</p>

<p>Since this unit test is about pausing the request body writing, it seems that instead of pausing, curl is signalling an end of the body. Just to double check, I found the function in <code>c-hyper.c</code> that returns <code>HYPER_POLL_READY</code> and body chunks, set a breakpoint, and observed it returning done because of a user call to pause.</p>

<p>So, the action items from debugging this are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues">File an issue with hyper</a> to expand the <a href="https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/ffi/fn.hyper_body_set_data_func.html">docs</a> to say more about pausing. They do say some, but it&rsquo;s easy to miss.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/curl/curl/issues">File an issue with curl</a> about the need to adjust how bodies are paused.</li>
<li><strong>Bonus</strong>: fix the code and send a pull request. But if you&rsquo;re not familiar with C, even just the issues identifying the underlying problem help immensely!</li>
</ul>
