<blockquote>
  <p>hyper is a protective and efficient HTTP library for all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have a <a href="https://seanmonstar.com/2023/2022-02-22-hyper-10-timeline/">timeline</a> for how to get to <a href="https://hyper.rs">hyper</a> 1.0, and a <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/2772">vision</a> of what it looks like. Next up is a proposal for how to get there. That&rsquo;s this new <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/2806">roadmap</a>.</p>

<p>The purpose of the roadmap is to map out what hyper looks like now, and exactly how it needs to change to match up with the <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/2772">VISION</a>.</p>

<p>The roadmap starts by describing current known issues with hyper v0.14, after having spoken to many users.</p>

<p>Then, after using the tenets defined in the vision to prioritize and make decisions, the proposed changes are listed. A central theme is making hyper stable, flexible, and ready for the future.</p>

<p>The roadmap includes a growable FAQ in the appendix. As the proposal receives feedback, the answers to that feedback should usually result in documenting it in that FAQ. There&rsquo;s one question in particular that I want to inline here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Isn&rsquo;t this making hyper harder?</h3>
  
  <p>We are making hyper more <strong>flexible</strong>. As noted in the <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/2772">VISION</a>, most use cases of hyper require it to be flexible. That <em>can</em> mean that the exposed API is lower level, and that it feels more complicated. It should still be <strong>understandable</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>But the hyper 1.0 effort is more than just the single <code>hyper</code> crate. Many useful helpers will be migrated to a <code>hyper-util</code> crate, and likely improved in the process. The <a href="https://seanmonstar.com/2023/2022-02-22-hyper-10-timeline/">timeline</a> also points out that we will have a significant documentation push. While the flexible pieces will be in hyper to compose how they need, we will also write guides for the <a href="https://hyper.rs">hyper.rs</a> showing people how to accomplish the most common tasks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please give us <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/2806">feedback</a>. This is a joint effort. Only together can we make HTTP safer for all. After the roadmap is merged, we&rsquo;ll file <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues">issues</a> for all the pieces of work, to allow more fine-grained discussion, and to track the progress. Exciting times are ahead!</p>
