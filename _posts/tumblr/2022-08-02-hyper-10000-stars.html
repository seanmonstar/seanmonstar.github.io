<p>Today, <a href="https://hyper.rs">hyper</a> reached 10,000 stars on GitHub!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/bba8a7e611ee1d2ab1538de0b9b1295c/21d450f404d79352-a0/s540x810/051599114c370e9a976fb36bca880f8567bb74dd.png" alt="Screenshot of hyper with 10k stars"/></a></p>

<p>What does that mean? Not much. It simply means ten thousand people clicked the star button for <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper">hyperium/hyper</a>. But hey, I&rsquo;m not one to give up a reason to celebrate!</p>

<p>I had projected the rate of stars per day, and knew we&rsquo;d reach 10k around the beginning of August. On the 1st, I setup a little script to check the GitHub API every 30 minutes, print out the new number, and continue until it reached the target number. That happened around 1:30am Pacific Time, this morning!</p>

<p>Really, this is thanks to all of <em>you</em>, for contributing and using hyper. <strong>Thank you!</strong></p>
