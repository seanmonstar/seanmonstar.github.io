Today, [hyper](https://hyper.rs) reached 10,000 stars on GitHub!

[![Screenshot of hyper with 10k stars](https://64.media.tumblr.com/bba8a7e611ee1d2ab1538de0b9b1295c/21d450f404d79352-a0/s540x810/051599114c370e9a976fb36bca880f8567bb74dd.png)](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper)

What does that mean? Not much. It simply means ten thousand people clicked the star button for [hyperium/hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper). But hey, I’m not one to give up a reason to celebrate!

I had projected the rate of stars per day, and knew we’d reach 10k around the beginning of August. On the 1st, I setup a little script to check the GitHub API every 30 minutes, print out the new number, and continue until it reached the target number. That happened around 1:30am Pacific Time, this morning!

Really, this is thanks to all of _you_, for contributing and using hyper. **Thank you!**
