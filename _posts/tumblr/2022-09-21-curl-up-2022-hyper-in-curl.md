On September 15th, [I presented a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXB9AkG1QwI) for [curl-up 2022](https://github.com/curl/curl-up/wiki/2022) about the ongoing work to get hyper into curl. The topics I touched on were:

- **Why?** [For a (memory) safer internet](https://seanmonstar.com/blog/how-using-hyper-in-curl-can-help-make-the-internet/).
- What we did: the hyper HTTP backend in curl.
- Symbiosis: how both libraries benefited even when not integrated.
- Are we there yet? Pointing out the [“help us” instructions](https://seanmonstar.com/blog/help-stabilize-hyper-in-curl/) and [kanban board of final tests](https://github.com/orgs/hyperium/projects/2/views/1), and a big thank you all who have helped so far.
- What **you** can do now.
