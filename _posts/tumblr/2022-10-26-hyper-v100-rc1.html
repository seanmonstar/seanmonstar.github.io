<p>I&rsquo;m thrilled to announce that the first release candidate for <a href="https://hyper.rs">hyper</a> 1.0 is now available. hyper is a protective and efficient HTTP library for all. You can <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.1">try it out</a> immediately, leave us <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues">feedback</a>, or keep on reading to see what&rsquo;s going on.</p>

<h3>What&rsquo;s all this about 1.0</h3>

<p>At the <a href="https://seanmonstar.com/2023/2022-01-04-hyper-ish-2021-in-review/">beginning</a> of the year, I said we&rsquo;d be releasing hyper 1.0, and then shared a <a href="https://seanmonstar.com/2023/2022-02-22-hyper-10-timeline/">timeline</a> to get it done. We started by defining a <a href="https://seanmonstar.com/2023/2022-03-08-hypers-vision/">VISION</a>. That was the <em>destination</em>, where we were going. Shortly thereafter, we had a <a href="https://seanmonstar.com/2023/2022-04-06-hyper-10-roadmap/">ROADMAP</a>. That was <em>how we get there</em>. Then, the development work began and continued throughout the summer.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re pulling into view of the destination. It&rsquo;s just over there, on the horizon. Now&rsquo;s the time to make sure everything feels good before we park in a <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/master/docs/VISION.md#stability-promise">stable spot</a>. That&rsquo;s what the Release Candidate is for!</p>

<h3>What&rsquo;s in RC1</h3>

<h4>What has changed</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.1">CHANGELOG</a> has a fuller list, but let me briefly explain a few bigger changes. What we used to call the &ldquo;high-level&rdquo; API pieces have been removed (<code>hyper::Client</code> and <code>hyper::Server</code>) from the core library. The &ldquo;runtime&rdquo; integration has been removed, which includes the types that used Tokio&rsquo;s <code>TcpStream</code>, timers, and executor. We split up the <code>Connection</code> type to be have one per HTTP version. This is mostly to prepare for the eventual addition of HTTP/3, which will require a different IO type, but also provides performance improvements by removing a branch on every poll.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://seanmonstar.com/2023/2022-03-08-hypers-vision/">VISION</a> and <a href="https://seanmonstar.com/2023/2022-04-06-hyper-10-roadmap/">ROADMAP</a> include many of the reasons <em>why</em>. We did learn a couple things along the journey, mostly around the &ldquo;unresolved questions&rdquo; in the roadmap, and those appeared in specific issues containing proposals and discussion. Still, this is just a release candidate, I&rsquo;ll write up much more for the full launch.</p>

<h4>What isn&rsquo;t included (yet)</h4>

<p>Some of the things that were removed are planned to appear in <code>hyper-util</code>, but aren&rsquo;t there quite yet. Also, a couple core features that were proposed in the ROADMAP are still being worked on, but since they&rsquo;re <em>additions</em>, and not critical, it didn&rsquo;t seem wise to block waiting on them.</p>

<h4>What could change?</h4>

<p>Theoretically, I suppose anything could. But it&rsquo;s unlikely that there would be <em>large</em> changes. Still, the entire point of Release Candidates is to get feedback about whether some changes are needed before we freeze for the full release. I expect those to be small in scope. You can watch what remains to be done on <a href="https://github.com/orgs/hyperium/projects/1/views/2">the 1.0 project board</a>. Most are additions, things that would change the API will labeled as such.</p>

<h3>Who should try it</h3>

<p>Please give it a try if these apply to you, and you <strong>want to help contribute</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Those who mostly use the &ldquo;low-level&rdquo; <code>conn</code> API, <code>hyper::server::conn</code> and <code>hyper::client::conn</code>.</li>
<li>Framework authors, such that you build a library on top of those APIs.</li>
<li>Or even if you work on <em>applications</em> that use those directly, instead of <code>hyper::Client</code> and <code>hyper::Server</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We want your experience reports.</p>

<p>And who should <em>wait</em>?</p>

<ul>
<li>If you make heavy use of <code>hyper::Client</code>, because of its connection pooling, a replacement isn&rsquo;t yet available.</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t have time to kick some tires and tell us what hurt, wait until we make it smoother.</li>
<li>If you use a library built on top of hyper, well you won&rsquo;t need to do anything until that library does!</li>
</ul>

<h3>What will we be doing next?</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ll be actively and passively collecting feedback. Anyone is welcome to try it out, and file issues about anything you find. You can also join us on Discord. We&rsquo;ll also be approaching teams from using hyper in different ways, to make sure the &ldquo;use cases&rdquo; from the VISION are taken care of. What we learn from this will likely mean some more release candidate versions will be published.</p>

<p>We also are starting up a docs and guides push. We want a smooth, complete upgrade guide when 1.0.0 pops. Some patterns that used to be built into hyper&rsquo;s core are now done with more modular pieces, involving multiple crates. So we will update and create new <a href="https://hyper.rs/guides">guides</a> explaining how to do so.</p>

<p>Several of the &ldquo;missing pieces&rdquo; involve porting useful patterns over to the <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper-util">hyper-util</a> crate. We didn&rsquo;t block the first release canidate on these because they aren&rsquo;t <em>required</em> to try out the core. But many people will certainly want several things over there!</p>

<h3>Thanks &lt;3</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been very proud of our wonderful contributors, some who have been here for a while, and several who recently showed up. You&rsquo;ve made this project the success it is, and helped get move hyper along the journey to 1.0. I&rsquo;ll put together a full list of all that helped as part of the final 1.0.0 announcement. Until then, thank you all so much!</p>

<h3>What can <em>you</em> do?</h3>

<p>You can go read the <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.1">CHANGELOG</a>, or view the rendered <a href="https://docs.rs/hyper/1.0.0-rc.1">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>You can try it out in your project:</p>

<pre><code class="toml">[dependencies]
# you don't need to use "full", you can enable less features if you want
hyper = { version = "1.0.0-rc.1", features = ["full"] }
</code></pre>
