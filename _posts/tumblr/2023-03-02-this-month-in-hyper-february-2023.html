<p>After <a href="https://seanmonstar.com/2023/2023-01-18-hyper-ish-2022-in-review/">recapping the 2022 year</a>, here&rsquo;s what the amazing contributors have been doing to make <a href="https://hyper.rs">hyper</a> ever better during January and February of 2023.</p>

<h3>Releases</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/releases/tag/v0.14.24">hyper v0.14.24</a>: fixes some expect-continue behavior, and reduces the internal max allocation in <code>to_bytes</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hyperium/h2/releases/tag/v0.3.16">h2 v0.3.16</a>: adds a missing piece for Extended CONNECT, and several bug fixes (memory reduction, panics)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/releases/tag/v0.11.14">reqwest v0.11.14</a>: adds <code>Proxy::no_proxy(url)</code> that works like the <code>NO_PROXY</code> environment variable, and several internal optimizations reducing copies and memory allocations.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tower-rs/tower-http/releases/tag/tower-http-0.4.0">tower-http v0.4.0</a>: a new decompression layer for Requests, <code>ServeDir</code> and <code>ServeFile</code> now translates IO errors into Responses, and adds a more flexible <code>ValidateRequest</code> layer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>hyper 1.0</h3>

<p>We released <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.3">RC3</a>, which fixed up some missing pieces in the API. Places needing an <code>Executor</code> now ask for one, and we added <code>hyper::rt::bounds</code> to publicly expose <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/3097">nameable but future-proof Executor trait &ldquo;aliases&rdquo;</a>, so libraries building on top of hyper can use them as bounds. We also added a few state getters for <code>SendRequest</code> which were needed for the next exciting part.</p>

<p><strong>The higher-level pooling <code>Client</code> from 0.14.x has been ported to <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper-util">hyper-util</a></strong>. This was the most common blocker preventing people from trying out the release candidates. You can now use the <code>legacy::Client</code> with <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.3">hyper 1.0.0-rc.3</a>, and have the normal connecting/pooling client experience you&rsquo;re used to (see the <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/hyper-util/blob/master/examples/client.rs">example</a>).</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re still in the <a href="https://seanmonstar.com/2023/2022-11-15-hyper-polish-period/">hyper polish period</a> ðŸ’…. There&rsquo;s still a little bit of time left to get us your feedback! It&rsquo;s the <em>most important</em> part of this period. Or join us in one of the four polish areas (or help lead one)! You can also come <a href="https://discord.gg/kkwpueZ">chat</a> with us about anything.</p>

<p>We took some extra time to focus on <a href="https://github.com/orgs/hyperium/projects/1/views/6">RC4</a>, which has the last few breaking changes to go. Likely, hyper will vendor it&rsquo;s own IO traits, and change <code>Service::call</code> to be <code>&amp;self</code> instead of <code>&amp;mut self</code>. See the related issues if you have feedback.</p>

<p>The extra time will also allow us to investigate having a security review done for 1.0, to prevent any gotchas.</p>

<h3>HTTP/3</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re working on HTTP/3 in a separate crate, <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/h3">h3</a>, with the goal of fitting it into <a href="https://hyper.rs">hyper</a>.</p>

<p>Within the next couple days, we&rsquo;d like to <a href="https://github.com/hyperium/h3/issues/125">publish a v0.0.1 to crates.io</a>. The API likely will change in the very near future, but knowing exactly how requires allowing <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/1599#issuecomment-1227414443">experimenters like reqwest</a> to try it out.</p>
