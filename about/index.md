I’m Sean McArthur, a [software engineer](https://github.com/seanmonstar), wandering the Internets.

An unordered list of the things I’m passionate about:

- **Building tools** or basic building blocks **for other engineers** to go invent things I couldn’t possibly imagine.
- Using **the Rust programming language**, as it’s currently the least-bad option I have found that offers: safety, speed, and expressiveness.
- **Networking** and protocols (like **HTTP**, QUIC, etc), since once you get multiple computers working together, you can do anything.
- Working in and promoting **open source** practices. We can do so much more when we join with a larger community, and can impact people anywhere in the world.
