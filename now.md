Updated April 22, 2025. In spirit of [/now](https://nownownow.com/about).

- Driving [hyper post-1.0](/blog/hyper-roadmap-2025): docs, hyper-util, http3, obersvability
  - Bringing [reqwest pieces](/blog/modular-reqwest) to hyper-util and tower
- Contemplating HLists (specialization?) (such as [warp](/blog/warp), but much more)
- Wishing the `std::error::Error` trait [could be good](https://github.com/seanmonstar/errors)
- Finding [sponsors and retainers](/sponsor) for my open source work
