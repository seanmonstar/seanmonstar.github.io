I’m an [independent maintainer](/blog/independent-open-source-maintainer), so sponsors enable me to continue to provide features, bug fixes, **security** reports, triage, mentoring, and answering of questions.

If your business depends on the [open source software that I maintain](https://github.com/seanmonstar), consider sponsoring my work. A simple mental exercise is to consider how difficult or expensive it would be if I had to stop maintaining them, and you had to replace them or write your own. Then use that to determine how much to sponsor my work. Consider it a business risk mitigation.

Here are a few ways to do so:

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/seanmonstar)
- [Patreon](https://patreon.com/seanmonstar)

### Something More?

A retainer with me could provide your company with even more value, such as:

- Private office hours
- Private reviews
- Expert advice
- **Security support**
